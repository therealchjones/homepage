<h2>Nobody&#39;s Home</h2>
<p>This isn&#39;t a blog.  This isn&#39;t a profile page, something that
gets updated with self-indulgent random thoughts or even peak events in
the author&#39;s life.  This isn&#39;t intended for &ldquo;social
networking&rdquo;, to explore feelings or make up experiences, or for the
author to be a star of cyberspace or the recipient of venture capital.  
(Of course, if a well-meaning venture capitalist needs to offload some
cash, the author is not refusing.)</p>
<p>I am not a beautiful and unique snowflake.</p>
<p>I am an Internet user, one who tries to make things work, Get Things
Done<sup>&reg;</sup>, and add just a little bit to the nigh-infinite and
rapidly expanding space from which I take so much.  My name&#39;s 
Christian&nbsp;Jones, though that&#39;s far from unique as well.  I am
sometimes chjones or therealchjones, christianjonesmd, aleph0, or, in
some previous nearly-forgotten life, heremond or hrothgar.</p>
<p>And, as anyone who recognized the names in the previous paragraph will
certainly note, I am a dork.</p>
<p>This is my homepage.  It is not particularly original, but is a tiny
entrance into the areas of my online life where I continue to spend my
time and energy.  At some point, the content of previous such homepages may 
be available here, as might the ongoing and increasingly less frequent 
diatribes that punctuate my minimally creative existence.  The 
ethereally electronic projects with which I am most concerned are linked
here; the pages elsewhere on which most of my day-to-day mundanity 
is documented are noted as well.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t find anything of interest, well, welcome to my
world.</p>
