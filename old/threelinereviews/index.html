<h1><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/">chjones</a>&#39;s 
Three-line Reviews</h1>

<p>Three-line reviews are bad.  They tell you little (if anything) about
the subject being reviewed, and tend (at least in aggregate) to offer
more about the subject doing the reviewing.  Hardly anyone likes them.</p>

<p>As it happens, I&#39;m an exception.  Sure, all of the above is true, 
but writing a pithy review without using more than 216 characters is an
interesting exercise, one that can even be quite difficult if taken
seriously.  Add the opportunity to quickly skim reviews without delving
too much into the text, the nigh complete lack of spoilers due to lack 
of space, and one can build up a useful catalog of such reviews.  (Well,
useful to that one, if no others.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to do just that on this site.  If you&#39;re looking for
particularly thoughtful or original commentary, please look elsewhere.
If you&#39;re looking for in-depth analysis of a subject, please do the 
same.  If your goal is to decide at a glance if a movie&#39;s worth
a $15 ticket or if you should pay for express shipping on that book whose
cover is just <em>so</em> pretty, thanks for visiting.</p>

<p>Each review here uses no more than 216 characters, including
punctuation and spaces.  The punctuation&#39;s correct, but the
sentences aren&#39;t always complete.  It&#39;s not poetry, it&#39;s
not prose, it&#39;s just a three-line review.</p>
