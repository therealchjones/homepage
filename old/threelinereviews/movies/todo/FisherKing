<p>Touted as a decent look at mental illness and the homeless, this film
doesn&#39;t quite live up to my expectations.  Both <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/">Robin Williams</a> and <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313/">Jeff Bridges</a> perform well, but
I&#39;m left &ldquo;too satisfied&rdquo; by the story, certainly not something
expected from any story about mental illness or the homeless.  Still, an
entertaining film that&#39;s worth seeing once.  Three stars.</p>
