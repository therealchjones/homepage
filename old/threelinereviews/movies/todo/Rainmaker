<p>Nothing extraordinary.  Perhaps that's the problem, in fact&mdash;a law
movie written by John Grisham and directed by Francis Ford Coppola holds
a lot of promise, and this one just doesn't live up to it.  Matt Damon
stars as a believably naive just-graduated attorney, and works with
wonderful-as-always Danny DeVito to bring down a large insurance company.
Lots of star power in this one (it also includes Danny Glover and Claire
Danes), but only adequately entertaining.  Three stars.</p>
