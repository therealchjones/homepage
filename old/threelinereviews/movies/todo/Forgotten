<p>Not bad for your standard <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/">X-Files</a>-esque psychological
&ldquo;thriller&rdquo;, but not that thrilling, either.  <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000194/">Julianne Moore</a> ably portrays
a woman whose physical reminders of her deceased son begin to disappear, but
she won&#39;t forget.  Blah, blah, blah, aliens probably did it.  Three stars
for the edge-of-your-seat factor, but no need to see it twice.</p>
