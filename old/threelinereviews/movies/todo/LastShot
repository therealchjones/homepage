<p>Seemed so promising, but left me without as many laughs as it promised.
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000111/">Matthew Broderick</a> is a
new Hollywood director, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000285/">Alec
Baldwin</a> is the producer who decides to make his film&mdash;except the 
producer is actually an FBI agent who&#39;s just faking the movie to sting
the mob, or the Teamsters, or somebody.  Seriously, if Matthew Broderick keeps
making movies like this and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327162/">The
Stepford Wives</a>, I&#39; going to have to write off any new movies he makes
and go back to watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/">Ferris
Bueller&#39;s Day Off</a> a few more times.  Two stars.</p>
