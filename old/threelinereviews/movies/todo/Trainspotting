<p>One of the &ldquo;new classics&rdquo; for the drugged masses that are we.
Not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/">Ewan McGregor</a>&#39;s
first film, but certainly his first memorable one.  I won&#39;t comment on how
realistic the movie is, but it is quite entertaining, and even a little
thought-provoking, but not for those with a weak stomach.  Original, worth a
watch, but probably not worth a second.  Three stars.</p>
