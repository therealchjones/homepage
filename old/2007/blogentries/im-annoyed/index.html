            mostly because just about everything pisses me off these days.
I&apos;m annoyed that there was a strong idiot turnout in the
California elections a couple of weeks ago, but when is there not?
I&apos;m annoyed that I&apos;ve started to get unsolicited commercial
email on my USC email account, even addressed to
&ldquo;Dr. Jones&rdquo;, but I get so much unsolicited
&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; email that this single message I received today
shouldn&apos;t be nearly as annoying as it is.  I&apos;m annoyed that
I won&apos;t be at home today when <a
href="http://www.ups.com">UPS</a> shows up with <a
href="http://www.sharpusa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,698,00.html">my
new toy</a>, even though I should just be thrilled that Lindsey bought
me this great little Linux-powered PDA as an early birthday
present.  Mostly, I&apos;m just annoyed that I tend to wake up
perfectly happy and then get annoyed within a half hour.

<p>Oh, so exams were fine.  I won&apos;t have official results for a
few days still, but I ended up above eighty percent overall;  the
exams from a couple weeks ago will be combined with another week of
exams in December, and seventy percent (or so) of the total will be
considered passing.  Shouldn&apos;t be a problem, and I&apos;m mostly
just worried that performing reasonably well on the previous tests
without working too hard simply means I won&apos;t work too hard this
mini-term either.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve got Linux running fairly well on my laptop.  <a
href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> 9.1, at least until I
have my own distribution ready to run <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.  There are still a few minor
shortcomings, most notably the lack of a good, simple, open source VPN
client, so I can&apos;t just sit out in the quad and use the wireless
network.</p>

<p>It&apos;s ICM day again, which means we&apos;ll go over to County
to see some patients, write up our findings in as professional a
manner as possible, and then maybe present our findings to one
another.  That all sounds wonderful, but ends up generally being a
session in which we listen to patients for about forty minutes and
then have no idea what&apos;s actually wrong with them.  However, we
have also just learned to do the most basic writeups, HPIs (History of
Present Illness).  Funny&mdash;it actually makes you feel like a
doctor.</p>
<p>Home life is fine, but Lindsey&apos;s working very hard.
She&apos;s got an exam she&apos;s worried about tomorrow, and the
first actuarial exam on November 6.  I&apos;ve been trying to help out
as much as possible (since I&apos;m not really working all that hard
at school), but she&apos;s mostly stressed.</p>

<p>Off to ICM.  God, I hope I don&apos;t get too annoyed today.  Fat
chance.</p>
