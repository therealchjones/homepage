            So, in a way, this makes the move easier.  <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/press/pr/pr032707.php">Best Buy has purchased Speakeasy</a>.  Far and away, my favorite ISP, which has unerringly offered excellent customer service and the right to run my own servers and such, has taken a nice &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; approach to copyright, and seems to have always been a friend of the techie, is now a subsidiary of The Man, the bastion of consumerism which I can&#39;t imagine being so kind.

<p>I was trying to decide whether or not to stick with Speakeasy;  DSL is now significantly slower than cable or fiber, and the service is still quite a bit more expensive than that from the local phone company.  Still, though, it was worth it (especially since I don&#39;t have cable and fiber isn&#39;t available in my neighborhood).  With the move, though, I was rethinking this;  with Speakeasy (as I know and love it, at least) being out of the picture, this should simplify the situation a bit.</p>
