            Yeah, I&#39;m still here.  I got the PowerBook <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/2005/11/im-getting-powerbook.html">I wrote about</a>, and it&#39;s fantastic.  Sure enough, I&#39;ve been working on turning it into my primary computer, but I don&#39;t really have enough time at the moment to even <em>have</em> a primary computer.

<p>Who knew pediatrics would be time consuming?  I really expected it to be similar to internal medicine, but that schedule was <em>sweet</em>.  Here at <a href="http://www.childrenshospitalla.org/">CHLA</a>, I&#39;m working quite a bit, learning a ton, but it&#39;s taking a ton of time, too.  I tend to get home and just crash instead of studying or doing extra work&mdash;I&#39;m just <em>drained</em> when I get out of here.  The teaching is wonderful, but time consuming&mdash;sometimes it would just be nice to get the work done and go home.</p>

<p>And speaking of going home, prolly isn&#39;t gonna happen anytime soon.  I&#39;m on call today, have finished all my work, and am updating my blog instead of studying while I wait for patients to show.  My current supervisor has said I can go at 6 if we haven&#49;t gotten any admissions&hellip; and look at that, as I was writing the last clause we got a transfer who&#39;s an &ldquo;excellent learning opportunity&rdquo; for me.  See you later.</p>
