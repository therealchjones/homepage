            Yeah, that&apos;s a quick-and-dirty estimate of what med
school&apos;s costing me per day&mdash;and is based on last
year&apos;s tuition, doesn&apos;t include books, supplies, or living
expenses, and doesn&apos;t take into account the future interest I pay
on the loans that are providing that money.

<p>But I start shadowing in the ER tonight!  It seems a little odd
that I&apos;m essentially in the same position as I was 3 and a half
years ago&mdash;a little annoyed with what I&apos;m doing and hoping
that volunteering my free time in the Emergency Room will bring back
some hope for a real career.  Sure, I know a little more about what to
expect and will be wearing a snazzy white coat tonight, but I&apos;ll
still be trying to make a good first impression and will be
sacrificing what tiny amount of social life I have.</p>

<p>I&apos;m also slightly concerned that I&apos;m at school at 0655,
and will be here until at least 2300.  I&apos;m a first year medical
student; I didn&apos;t think that was supposed to happen yet.  Oh,
well, maybe I&apos;m just putting in penance for not working very hard
in graduate school.</p>

<p>In any case, I&apos;ve actually been able to stick to the new
schedule I made up for myself, although I&apos;ve admittedly only
sufferred through one day of it.  For those of you keeping track (if
you actually are, please don&apos;t tell me&mdash;it&apos;s a little
frightening), I&apos;ve lost 29 pounds since April 24.  Days like
today should help that even more!</p>
