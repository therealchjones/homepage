            Okay, so I&apos;m merely referring to studying, working on my
personalized <a href="http://www.linux.org">GNU/Linux</a>
distribution, and updating this blog again.  I&apos;ve been trying to
relax, but constantly feeling like there&apos;s quite a bit to get
done.  So, in response, I&apos;ve just decided to get more done and
let that be its own relaxation.

<p>I&apos;m once again working on what is tentatively entitled InFiniT
GNU/Linux, a &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; that I&apos;ll be happy to
share but will be geared only toward the ix86 architecture and will be
optimized for the computers that I own and use, and is therefore
unlikely to be of much use to anyone else.  I&apos;m not particularly
worried about things like the <a href="http://www.linuxbase.org">Linux
Standards Base</a> and the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs">File
Hierarchy Standard</a> (anymore); I&apos;ll keep things generally the
way they are, but won&apos;t make special efforts to do so.  The idea
is to eventually customize (i.e., tear down and build back up) my own
operating system, so there&apos;s no reason to stick with convention
just for the hell of it.  On the other hand, as I would still not
consider myself a guru per se, I&apos;m not going to try and change
things just yet.</p>

<p>Studying has had to kick back into full gear with our first real
patient case, a young man with cystic fibrosis.  My assignment for the
case was fairly straightforward (an analysis of major clinical
problems presented by CF patients and the pathophysiology leading to
them), but took some time.  We also had our first gross anatomy
dissection (the superficial back) on Friday, so that encompassed some
work in and of itself.</p>

<p>Friday also brought our white coat ceremony, so now I even look
like a medical student ready to see patients.  With any luck,
that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;ll be doing tomorrow&mdash;it&apos;s
our first &ldquo;Intro to Clinical Medicine&rdquo; (ICM) where we may
actually have a chance to visit the wards.  It&apos;s going to be
weird to be back in a hospital.</p>

<p>And, obviously, I&apos;m updating this page again.  Keep checking
back&mdash;still more to come!</p>
