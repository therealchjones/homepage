            Okay, so this little note is actually about <em>ambition</em>, not
greed, but I like the quote.

<p>It&apos;s been almost a month since the last time I updated the content
here&mdash;not my longest lag, but nonetheless one I&apos;m not terribly
happy about.  I&apos;d like to say I didn&apos;t update because I&apos;ve
been working hard or busy with medical school, but the truth is I&apos;ve
just been screwing around.  Since I&apos;m starting to pay for that
(not with money or failure, but just feeling a little guilty), I&apos;ve
realized there are only two real possibilities for dealing with that:</p>

<ol>

<li>Stop feeling guilty about it.</li>

<li>Change it.</li>

</ol>

<p>Sure, the first option is tempting, and something I&apos;m normally
quite good at, but not necessarily what many would consider to be the
&ldquo;best&rdquo; solution.  Add to that the fact that I&apos;ll need
to eventually use the fruits of my labor in landing and performing a
job&mdash;not to mention the fact that I actually like and <em>want</em>
to know the material&mdash;and I&apos;m stuck with changing my behavior.
In deciding how best to do that, I&apos;ve reached a conclusion that
I&apos;m not sure I would have agreed with even a few months ago:</p>

<p>Ambition is good.</p>

<p>Perhaps, anyway, ambition <em>can</em> be good.  I&apos;m not talking
about the cut-throat, be-the-best-at-all-costs kind of ambition, rather
<em>personal</em> ambition that encourages one to be the best he can be.
(Why did I switch to third person there for a second?)  In that light,
it&apos;s also important to share that ambition;  not to be a braggart
or to demean or intimidate others, but as an additional motivation.
If I tell my friends that I&apos;m going to lose ten pounds in the next
thirty days, it&apos;s likely I&apos;ll be held accountable for that.
They&apos;ll ask me how it&apos;s going, and thirty days later I damn
well <em>better</em> have lost those ten pounds.  No, it&apos;s not to
tell others they should lose, and it&apos;s not about competing to see
who can lose the most the fastest;  it&apos;s about accountability.</p>

<p>In that spirit, I&apos;m going to do better
on the only real way we&apos;re measured here at <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/">Keck</a>:  I&apos;m going
to do better on the exams.  Sure, there&apos;s a touchy-feely quality to
improving on the more subjective measures like professionalism or patient
care, but the fact is I don&apos;t feel those are my weakest areas, and
it would be difficult to monitor my progress in improving them even if
they were.  Therefore, exams it is.  There are three system exams left
before our yearly comprehensive exam in May or June;  I&apos;m going to
do <em>at least</em> as well as:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Hematology and Clinical Immunology</dt>

<dd>90%.  I&apos;m less than two weeks away from this exam.  In my
last post, I mentioned that the topic was easy.  Sure, it is still the
easiest system we&apos;ve studied so far, but it&apos;s not like I really
<em>have</em> been studying for the last three weeks&hellip;</dd>

<dt>Neurosciences</dt>

<dd>93%.  I&apos;m not sure exactly what to expect from this system.
I know Gross Anatomy is supposed to be fairly difficult (I&apos;ve
heard, actually, that the entire system is supposed to be fairly
difficult), but I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the process parts
of Neurosciences, especially the pathologies.  We&apos;ll see, but I
want to keep improving&hellip;</dd>

<dt>Musculoskeletal</dt>

<dd>95%.  This one&apos;s short.  Plenty of memorization, and only about
two weeks to do it in.  Still improving&hellip;</dd>

<dt>Comprehensive exam</dt>

<dd>92%.  Just after Memorial Day, covering the entire first year.
This is the closest I get to being realistic&mdash;with any luck,
it won&apos;t involve actually staying overnight in the MDLs.  (Okay,
so I&apos;m sure that won&apos;t actually be the case.  Staying up all
night at home, however, seems fairly likely.)  Wish me luck!</dd>
