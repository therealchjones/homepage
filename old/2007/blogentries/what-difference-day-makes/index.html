            Wow.  Today was a good day.  I don&apos;t know what has made a
difference, but it could simply be that I had a much better
night&apos;s sleep.  Sure, there were still problems (it wouldn&apos;t
be a cross-country road trip without problems), but they just
didn&apos;t affect me as much.  For instance?  Well, it&apos;s
becoming readily apparent that the Ryder/Budget truck I&apos;ve rented
is a piece of crap.  The noise is horrible, and now it actually looks
like the tires are pieced together with electrical tape.

<p>We&apos;ve been staying in decent hotels (just for reference,
that&apos;s &ldquo;decent&rdquo; for poor students, not
&ldquo;decent&rdquo; for employed physicians).  Today&apos;s is the
second Sleep Inn we&apos;ve stayed in, and the second one we&apos;ve
had problems with.  Last time it was silly problems like a lack of
water pressure and the phone that didn&apos;t work;  this time
it&apos;s a bit more personal, apparently including a stubborn clerk
and a trainee who couldn&apos;t properly make a reservation.  Well, we
won&apos;t be staying in any more of these places (even if $50 a
night is a bargain to the $120 we spent at a &ldquo;Super 8&rdquo;);
I assured the clerk of that while using a little of my usual Charm and
Bullshit&trade;.</p>

<p>In any case, this stuff just hasn&apos;t been getting me down.  It
might help that we&apos;re less than 750 miles from Los Angeles;  we
shouldget there sometime early on Monday.  It, again, might be that I
slept reasonably well last night;  thankfully, the air conditioning at
the Super 8 was actually as cold as I like, and that probably
helped.</p>
