            No, I&#39;m not post-call, and it&#39;s not as flattering as you might think to consistently be asked.  Sure, it&#39;s nice to see that I fit in well on the surgery services, but do I really always seem like I&#39;ve been up all night?

<p>Admittedly, I&#39;m not typically a bucket of sunshine in the mornings, and I don&#39;t shave every day, and there are probably permanent stains on the front of every set of scrubs I own.  Still, isn&#39;t regularly asking if someone&#39;s post-call equivalent to seeing someone just coming from SuperCuts and asking &ldquo;what happened to your hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, this is the worst part of surgery so far, and that&#39;s really saying something.  I find that I&#39;m really cut out for it, if I can stand being away from home for what seems like days on end.  Trauma surgery, the first three weeks of the year, was the best rotation I&#39;ve had.  Really outstanding.  Non-trauma, or &ldquo;Emergency Surgery Service&rdquo; has been less interesting so far, but it&#39;s still surgery, and I still feel like I&#39;m fixing things and doing as well or better than most of my colleagues.  It might sound like blasphemy coming from a fan of emergency medicine, but I could seriously imagine myself doing surgery as a career.</p>

<p>So, the question to be answered follows naturally&mdash;can I imagine myself doing anything else?</p>
