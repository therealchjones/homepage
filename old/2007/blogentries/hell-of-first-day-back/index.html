            It&apos;s Lindsey&apos;s first day of work, and I don&apos;t have to be at the hospital until 10:30;  since she gets up at six for the ridiculous commute in, that gives me plenty of time, right?

<p>I get up at six with her, relax, watch a <a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com">Simpsons</a> on the <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a>, and start packing up.  I can&apos;t find my driver&apos;s license.  Mind you, this is really no big deal, since I don&apos;t drive to school/work and I can&apos;t come up with any particular reason why I would need it, but it&apos;s a bad sign.  An omen.  A portent.  Evidence of things not seen.</p>

<p>I realize that my license may be in the pockets of whatever I was wearing on the plane on Saturday.  Per my habit, in fact, it should be in my shirt pocket. It&apos;s not.  It&apos;s also not in the pocket of the sports coat I was wearing. (Yes, I was wearing a sports coat on the plane&mdash;more fallout of the Chicago story I haven&apos;t yet written.)  Therefore, it must be in the pockets of the pants I was wearing when I got home, but I can&apos;t find them anywhere (the pockets or the pants).  And it&apos;s not like this is a big house.  So no license.</p>

<p>Omen, I tell you.  Portent.  I&apos;m dropping a couple of work pants of Lindsey&apos;s off at the cleaner/tailor down the street to have them hemmed.  It&apos;s only about a quarter to half a mile, but I bike it anyway.  Figure I can leave straight from there.  It&apos;s maybe five minutes to nine.  I drop them off, and start trucking it back up the hill toward my house, on the way to the hospital.</p>

<p>I know what you&apos;re thinking.  Well, I have some ideas:</p>

<ol>

<li>Chris, you haven&apos;t biked in a while.  That bike may not be in the best shape.</li>

<li>Chris, you haven&apos;t biked in a while.  You may not be in the best shape.</li>

<li>Chris, you fat bastard, how are you going to bike four miles to school when you have that horrible head cold you wrote about yesterday?</li>

</ol>

<p>And, for one reason or another (hint:  I made sure the bike was in good shape before I left), I just couldn&apos;t make it up that hill.  I thought I was going to pass out.  Sure, I&apos;m in poor shape, but I don&apos;t really tend to get winded all that easily, so I&apos;ll just strike it up to the virus.</p>

<p>Still, not a problem.  No car, no bike, but there is always good old public transportation.  The bus isn&apos;t used nearly as much as it should be in L.A. considering the huge numbers of people going from place to place all the time.  They&apos;re clean, and, as the trip planner on the <a href="http://www.mta.net">MTA web site</a> will show you, you can get to places in reasonable amounts of time during rush hour.</p>

<p>Or you should be able to.  My estimated travel time, in fact, from my house to the hospital this morning is twenty-three minutes.  Not a problem.  Even after showering off the ridiculous amounts of sweat from my short and ill-fated bicycle trip (yes to diaphoretic and short of breath, no to chest pain and impending feeling of doom), it must only be about 9:10.  I head down to the closest bus stop, which is maybe halfway to the cleaner/tailor&apos;s, and wait just a couple of minutes for the bus.  All the time, of course, feeling remarkably obnoxious as I always do in my white coat.  At least I&apos;m in scrubs instead of that ridiculous shirt-and-tie thing.</p>

<p>Okay, I should interrupt here and mention that I&apos;m comfortable saying that all the little things that have happened so far are just bad luck.  Not really much I could have done, and I planned pretty well in case they happened anyway.  Not so much with the next thing.  No bad luck, really, just stupidity.</p>

<p>I got on the bus going the wrong way.  It&apos;s okay, I notice it right away, get off at the next stop and lose about ten minutes.  No, wait&hellip; that was a different universe.  In this one, I&apos;m not really sure I&apos;m going the wrong way for a good half hour, and for about a half hour after that I keep thinking it would be faster to stay on this bus and loop around than to try to catch another bus going the other way.  I really have no idea where the logic of this is stemming from in my brain, as I realize quite well that it doesn&apos;t make much sense, but I follow it anyway, until I see the fading dodo of the urban landscape, an actual payphone near one of the stops.</p>

<p>From there it&apos;s probably what you&apos;d expect.  I call the research coordinator, tell her &ldquo;long story short, I&apos;m stuck somewhere north of Pasadena and <em>hope</em> I can get there by eleven&rdquo;, and wait for the bus  going the other way.  It&apos;s the same bus, of course&mdash;the driver has turned around at the end of the line and come back.  I finally show up in the emergency medicine research office about 11:35 (nobody seems to care, and the one person I would expect to, Dr. Henderson, had worked the night before and wasn&apos;t there), walk around the surprisingly slow emergency room for a couple of hours while waiting for a patient with asthma to come in, and leave.  Oh, there was the joy of taking yet another bus home and walking two or three miles from where I departed, but that&apos;s quite minor at this point.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a message from Lindsey on my cell phone (which, of course, I&apos;d earlier forgotten, along with my watch) saying that her first day is going okay, which is very good to hear.  She&apos;ll be home soon, we&apos;ll have a hopefully less stressful evening&hellip; and then start it all over.</p>
