            So no doubt you&rsquo;ve heard that <a 
href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/030630/usnews/30california.htm">Arnold 
is likely
to run for Governor of California</a>.  Personally, I&rsquo;d like it to be unli
kely
that he&rsquo;ll be elected, but I can&rsquo;t really say that.  This is the sam
e state
that elected Reagan to Governor before the mad-cap fun-loving not-exactly-laid-b
ack
Eighties (a decade of which, perhaps surprisingly, I&rsquo;m actually quite a fa
n).
However, I did just see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181852">Terminator 3:
Rise of the Machines</a>, and I can&rsquo;t imagine this would be an effective p
olitical
tool for Schwarzenegger in any state.  Consider the following planks:

<dl>
<dt>Women&rsquo;s issues</dt><dd>At one point, Arnold &ldquo;whirls&rdquo; <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Loken,%20Kristanna">Kristanna Loken</a> (shoving
her head into a toilet), just before literally trying to crush her pretty little
face with his boot.  (Maybe the fact that she actually kicks his ass quite 
thoroughly is to be construed as a triumph for the gender.)</dd>
<dt>Crime</dt><dd>Actual image from the film:  Arnold, coffin full of weapons
in one arm, gigantic machine gun in another, annihilating at least 8 police cars
 as
the officers run for cover.  The upside?  A screen capture from Arnold&rsquo;s
&ldquo;terminal&rdquo; stating <code>HUMAN CASUALTIES: NONE</code>.  I can
see it now: <q>I nevah said it was okay to kill police officahs&mdash;just fiah 
at
them and destroy theah means of puhsoot.</q></dd>
<dt>War</dt><dd>Arnold goes to great lengths to help destroy those who are likel
y
to become his enemies later&mdash;oh, hold on; people might actually go for that
one.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; I very much enjoyed the movie.  I&rsquo;m just not
certain the country is ready for this particular entertainer to be an elected
official.  Yes, I know he <a 
href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/constitution/cons
titution_transcription.html#2.1.5">can&rsquo;t</a>
go on to the White House, but I would say Governor is quite 
possible&mdash;even likely.  Oh, well, good excuse to register to vote as soon
as possible after the move.</p>
