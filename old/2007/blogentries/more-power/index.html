            Don&#39;t want to write much (there&#39;s <em>so</em> much to talk 
about), but I did want to apologize for any downtime and note that there
may be more.

<p><a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8662257/">Southern California is in a
state of &ldquo;power emergency&rdquo;</a>, according to MSNBC.  Basically,
the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; power companies have several power plants
out of commission at the moment, and they can&#39;t keep up with record
demand&mdash;a bit of which my two air conditioners, home entertainment
system, and twelve computer probably have contributed.  Our house has had
(at least) three blackouts in the last 48 hours, and I wouldn&#39;t be
surprised to have more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m running relatively blind&mdash;most of my work is currently
on my Mac mini and an LCD or on my OpenBSD laptop.  I&#39;ve also got the
server, a couple of routers and access points, and the DSL modem all 
running.  That&#39;s really not bad as far as power drain goes, as I have 
all my other machines, including the power-hungry Windows computer, 
completely off at the moment.  More energy is going toward simply staying
cool, as it&#39;s <em>damn</em> hot here in LA.</p>

<p>The one nice thing is that this situation&#39;s given me a chance to
test my UPS systems.  They&#39;ve held up great, even though all the
machines I mentioned before (except the laptop) are hooked up to only
two of them.  They&#39;re consumer models from <a 
href="http://www.belkin.com/">Belkin</a> that have been on sale at 
one point or another, and they haven&#39;t turned off spontaneously 
yet.  (In each of the prior outages, I shut down the connected computers
and turned off the battery backups myself.)</p>

<p>The other lesson here, of course, is that I <em>really</em> need
a form of off-grid renewable energy of fairly large magnitude&mdash;or
somehow tap into one of the hospital&#39;s generators.</p>
