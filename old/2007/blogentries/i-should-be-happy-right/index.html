          <div class="post-body">
            No, this isn&rsquo;t some bipolar change from yesterday&rsquo;s post.  I 
just happened upon a <a 
href="http://www.thedigitalbits.com/rumormill.html#0117">rumor</a> that the
first season of ER will be released on DVD on June 13.  That&rsquo;s great,
right?  Even if it&rsquo;s no longer <a 
href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html">my favorite series</a>, 
I&rsquo;m still a fan, so I should be happy, right?

<p>Just one problem.  As it turns out, one of my major hobbies for the last
few months has been ripping the TNT reruns off my <a 
href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a>, editing them up all purty, and 
making some personal-use DVDs.  I must say they&rsquo;re pretty impressive;
more importantly, they&rsquo;ve taken quite a bit of work, with quite a bit
still to go.  I&rsquo;m about halfway done;  I even spent some money to 
recover some lost data from my latest hard drive crash.  (It&rsquo;s a little
difficult to recover 80 GB on the spur of the moment.)  So I should be 
happy not to have to deal with it anymore, right?</p>
<p>So why am I bummed?  I have plenty of hobbies; this won&rsquo;t leave
me bored and aimless.  And before you ask why not just finish this and not
buy the &ldquo;official&rdquo; copies, are you kidding?  Kinda weird little
ideas I have:  if I like something enough to put work into it, I certainly
like it enough to show even a modicum of appreciation those who can do the
job better than I.  (This is also a good argument for donating to free
software developers&mdash;if there were more people with this idea, it
might not be necessary to pay an arm and a leg for decent DVD authoring
software.)  (Of course, I&rsquo;m also selfish enough that I want the
better-quality professional versions.  Surround sound?  I can only hope!)</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll buy the sets.  And I&rsquo;ll keep working on my own.
Sure, I&rsquo;ll have the entire series, probably before Season 2 is 
released in stores.  Seems kind of pointless, though, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
