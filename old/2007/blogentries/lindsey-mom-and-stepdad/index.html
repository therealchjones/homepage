            &hellip;are visiting for a couple of days.  For me, this essentially means
no studying and no classes.  Of course, it was quite likely there would be no
studying anyway, and since tomorrow&#39;s Friday and I still had to go to ICM
this morning, it essentially means an afternoon of no classes.  That&#39;s
pretty good, I guess.

<p>I&#39;ve been a bit busy lately (no, not studying for the Cardiovascular
system exam I have next Friday, but still, busy), so haven&#39;t mentioned
my adventures last week.  The most gripping tale involves shadowing my ICM
instructor (who, as I mentioned a couple posts back, is the on-site physician
for a few concert and sports venues around LA).  Not bad&mdash;not much in
the way of medicine, but I got to attend the <a
href="http://www.vanhalen.org/">Van Halen</a> concert at the Staples Center
last Thursday.  Hey, Sammy Hagar was singing, so the concert itself wasn&#39;t
spectacular, but it was still really cool&mdash;not the least of which that
the suckers who paid for tickets shelled out $65 and up per.  The medicine
was actually disappointing:  a lady with nausea and another with pretty bad
hypertension and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.  Yeah, if I&#39;d studied harder
during Musculoskeletal, I&#39;d remember what that was, too.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular has been okay.  Either I&#39;ve missed a lot of material
during this system, or there really hasn&#39;t been that much.  I guess that
means that either they&#39;re trying to ease us back in or scare us back in.
We&#39;ll find out in another week.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do my best to
study during that week, but there will be television premieres, and I&#39;d
really like to finish reading <span class="title">House of God</span>&hellip;</p>
