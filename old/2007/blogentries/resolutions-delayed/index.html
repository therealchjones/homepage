          <div class="post-body">
            New Year&#39;s resolution time.  Note that because of (or thanks to) <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/2006/01/anniversary.html">my anniversary</a> falling on January 1 each year, Lindsey asked last year that I start all resolutions on January 2.  Seems I get pretty cranky the first few of days of any diet, and a diet always seems to be one of my resolutions (see the first couple below).  Not surprising, I guess, that she wouldn&#39;t want me to be particularly fussy on our anniversary.  Again, then, that precious mantra:  The-diet-starts-tomorrow.


<p>In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exercise (aerobic) at least thirty minutes <strong>every day</strong></li>
<li>Ingest less than two thousand calories <strong>every day</strong></li>
<li>Study at least one hour <strong>every day</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it.  Call days may be painful, but I&#39;m really going to try.  Note that these are the &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; resolutions;  I&#39;ve tried to limit myself to three that I will <em>always</em> do and not just <em>try</em> to do.  That  said, there are several things that didn&#39;t make the list but which I&#39;ll try to do anyway, somewhat more subjective things like &ldquo;keep better track of my money&rdquo; and &ldquo;do better at studying my non-medical interests&rdquo;.  We&#39;ll see how well those go.</p>

<p>For now, though, one more night of junk food and sitting in front of the computer and/or the television.  One more night of a happy new year&mdash;the pain starts whenever I wake up in the morning.</p>
