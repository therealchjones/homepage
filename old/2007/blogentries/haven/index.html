          <div class="post-body">
            I just finished the Neurosciences midterm, and have a couple hours to kill, so I thought I&apos;d mention a few things.  <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit</a> development has been on hold for about a week while I&apos;ve been studying, but I expect to get a 0.3 release out Real Soon Now&reg;.  It&apos;s still an excellent learning tool, but has been coming more slowly than I&apos;d like for a real desktop replacement.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I still plan to develop it, and still plan to use it as <em>my</em> system at some point&mdash;but for the moment, I&apos;m recommending a fairly new development, <a href="http://cobind.com/desktop.html">Cobind Desktop</a>.  Mind you, I haven&apos;t actually tried it yet, but it looks like the sort of thing I&apos;m looking for.

<p>Finally saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>;  not bad, not great, three stars.  Also saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>, and really enjoyed it:  four stars.  Probably the best I&apos;ve seen since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/">Big Fish</a>, which, admittedly, wasn&apos;t that long ago.</p>

<p>I&apos;m getting back into the Linux thing, probably partly because I&apos;ve
 been reading a bit of <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a>&apos;s stuff.  Oh, I&apos;m not as zealous (or as paranoid/careful) as he is, but
 he can get his point across.  I&apos;ve ended up not enjoying <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">The Art of Unix Programming</a> from a technical perspective as much as Mike Gancarz&apos;s Linux and the Unix Philosophy.  (Though I&apos;ll admit many disagree.)  However, ESR&apos;s shorter writings appeal to my ideals&mdash;and keep me interested.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve still got plenty of time to kill, so I&apos;ll once again start playing with some scripting tools.  Until next time&apos;.</p>
