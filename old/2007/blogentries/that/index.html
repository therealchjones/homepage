            Okay, so I have to get work done.  Digitizing, music, video, and
most especially programming are all now exclusively dedicated to
weekends.  I&apos;ll keep trying to make these little updates as often
as possible&mdash;who knows, without being allowed to program they may
even come more often.

<p>No, I haven&apos;t failed anything, and this is a self-imposed
rule, but this is something I have to do to get through medical school
successfully.  I need to work hard, and I need to spend time with
Lindsey, and everything else has to come after those two.  I already
am unable to spend as much time with her as I&apos;d like; and by my
new schedule I&apos;ll be spending even less.  The only hope is that
it will now actually be with her instead of screwing around on one
project or another.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll probably post my general schedule at some point, so you
can get an idea of what I&apos;m talking about, but anytime you start
with &ldquo;so there are 168 hours in a week&hellip;&rdquo; you
can&apos;t be going anywhere good.  I&apos;m purposely leaving 1230
Friday to 1230 Sunday free every week, but I do occasionally have
classes scheduled on Friday afternoon.  Other than that
&ldquo;weekend&rdquo; I have about an hour and a half
&ldquo;free&rdquo; each evening&mdash;I think it&apos;s safe to assume
I&apos;d like at least ten times that.</p>

<p>So I&apos;m continuing on all the myriad projects I
have&mdash;they&apos;ll just all be going much more slowly.</p>

<p>Changing subjects completely, I got to interview my first patient
today&mdash;or at least I should have.  We went over the the eighth
floor of County (a.k.a <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056758/">General Hospital</a>), and
I was told to interview a patient who was, well, less than coherent.
We&apos;re not talking a problematic accent or tangential rambling
here, we&apos;re talking moans and grunts.  So much for that.  I was
given another patient; this one was stuck in radiology.  So I just got
to sit in while Pete did his interview.  Arrgh.  I suppose I should be
grateful&mdash;some groups didn&apos;t even go to the hospital.</p>

<p>I start doing ER tagalongs on Thursday (six hours I could probably
spend at home, but I suppose it does help the career).  With any luck,
that will also reinvigorate me a bit&mdash;I guess it&mdash;s safe to
say that so far med school&apos;s good, but not all that
enjoyable.</p>
