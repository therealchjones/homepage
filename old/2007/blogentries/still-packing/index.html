          <div class="post-body">
            Getting ready for the big move, playing with my new laptop (for the more risqu&eacute; of you out there, that&rsquo;s
not merely the top of my lap), and making sure I have immunizations up the yinyang (well, in my arm, anyway). 
That&rsquo;s essentially how I&rsquo;ve been spending the last several days and 
how I plan to spend the next two to 
three weeks.  We&rsquo;re leaving on the 31st, driving from Central Florida to Southern California, and planning to arrive
about the 4th of August.  After that, I&rsquo;ll suffer through about a week without DSL, get hooked up again about the
same day I actually start medical school, and hope that none of the computers are damaged in the move.

<p>The gist?  This will be the last update for some time, or at least the last visible one for some time.  I do plan to
do some writing, both on some of the behind-the-scenes <a href="http://www.cpan.org">Perl</a> and some articles I&rsquo;ve
been meaning to get to (including why sweatshops are a good thing).  I&rsquo;ll 
do a bit of writing at the hotels we stay
at, a bit more once we arrive in LA, and (if I can force myself to take the time) regular updates while experiencing
med school.  I don&rsquo;t want to promise anything, but this site should actually become more active and infinitely
(sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t resist) more interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, you won&rsquo;t actually see any of that for a while.  In about a 
week, on the 28th or 29th, this will
become a placeholder page reminding you that I&rsquo;m in the process of a move.
  One of the deficiencies caused by
my desire to depend on others as little as possible is a lack of server colocation&mdash;so the server this is running
on will be in the back of a Budget rental truck along with all the rest of my crap.  Oh, I&rsquo;ll be updating on my
laptop&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll just have to take my word for it.  Everything should be back to normal (or better) by, at the
latest, about August 15.</p>

<p>The other drawback to the impending move and once again having to attend clas
ses is an indefinitely long hiatus on
my GNU/Linux distribution.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll still work on it from time
 to time, but I&rsquo;ll be making a serious
effort to concentrate most of my energy on cultivating my education and my relationship.  The last thing I need to be
worrying about is building my own distribution from scratch.  Don&rsquo;t get me
 wrong, I&rsquo;ll still be running
Linux, using and developing <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, and in general trying
to make things easy and difficult on myself at the same time;  I just won&rsquo;t be spending my time trying to make 
my efforts suitable for other people.  In a <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Quotes?0096697">great man&rsquo;s words</a>, 
&ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ve learnt your lesson, Lisa:  never help anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, stay tuned.  As always, still more to come&mdash;you&rsquo;ll just have to be patient.</p>
