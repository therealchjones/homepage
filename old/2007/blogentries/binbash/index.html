<p>Oh, sorry.  Been doing lots of scripting lately for <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux</a>.  It&apos;s going well,
and the entire project is progressing steadily, even if slowly.  Unfortunately, 
that means I&apos;ve been a bit derelict in my <a href="medschool">med school</a> studies;  that will have to change this weekend.  I&apos;ve only got about a week and a half of musculoskeletal left, then a week of studying before the first-year cumulative (which seems to be hotly debated, but only about whether it should be called &ldquo;cumes&rdquo; or &ldquo;comps&rdquo;).  Needless to say,</p>

<p>Lindsey and I were having a conversation while making cookies last night (and, no, that&apos;s not a euphemism).  I&apos;ve always been horrible with popular (and semi-popular) music knowledge, and I mentioned the fact that people have a very strange response when I mess up some sort of music knowledge (like being unable to tell the difference between REM and U2, or thinking that one of Led Zeppelin&apos;s front men is named Robert Page).  Their reaction is quite simple&mdash;it&apos;s complete lack of understanding.  No laughing, no mocking, no simple correcting.  Just a blank stare.  Lindsey&apos;s explanation?  They don&apos;t grok that I might know nothing about music.  Why?</p>

<p>They think I&apos;m <em>hip</em>.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was my reaction, too.  I can&apos;t believe anyone has ever thought I was hip.  Do hip people spend way too much time on computer stuff, have blogs they update far too seldom, use the word &ldquo;grok&rdquo;, and make self-deprecating fun of the fact that they&apos;re <em>not</em> hip?  Well, maybe they do now.  I may be so hip that I don&apos;t know what&apos;s hip anymore.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, did you know &ldquo;hoopdy&rdquo; was a word?  Also &ldquo;bling&rdquo;.  See?  I&apos;m hip.</p>

<p>I haven&apos;t been doing a lot of writing for the past several months, just the occasional tongue-in-cheek article for my friend Karen&apos;s zine.  (On the other hand, I&apos;m so un-hip that I thought zines started with the Internet, and that they actually started with the term &ldquo;E-zine&rdquo;.  Lindsey helpfully corrected me.)  In any case, I&apos;ve been reading a few of the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; in the <a href="http://www.socalphys.com">Southern California Physician</a>&apos;s annual writing contest.  They&apos;re horrible, and the winner got a few hundred dollars.  Looks like it might be time to get back into it.</p>

<p>But for now, only time to get back into classes.  Yay!  Two hours of pharmacology!</p>
