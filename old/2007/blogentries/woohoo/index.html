            Altogether, it&rsquo;s been a surprisingly good day.  Far from perfect, mind
you, but surprisingly good.  In fact, it&rsquo;s been very good&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just that those high points of the day took such a small portion of time.</p>
<p>Big news first&mdash;Lindsey and I finally found a place to live in L.A.
Actually, I suppose that&rsquo;s not strictly true&mdash;this particular house
(that&rsquo;s right, it isn&rsquo;t even an apartment!) was actually brought 
to our attention on June 25th, but we decided not to take it then.  It&rsquo;s
a little smaller than we&rsquo;d like, but the location is wonderful (three
miles from the med school), and I&rsquo;m very excited about having the 
autonomy that comes with renting a house.  Add to that the fact that the owner
is tangentially related to the medical school, and we come back to the realizati
on
that much more can be done with social &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; than through
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; channels.  It&rsquo;s a Good Thing&trade;.

<p>Other, much smaller but still fun, news, is that I bought a laptop.  Once
upon a time, I had an ancient 486 IBM Thinkpad with a broken display, but
this time I&rsquo;ve purchased a brand-spanking new <a 
href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> <a 
href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/series_inspn_notebooks.htm">Inspiro
n</a>
<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/model_inspn_inspn_1100.htm">1100
</a>
for a grand total of just over $1000 after tax and shipping.  It&rsquo;s not the
cutting edge <a href="http://www.motioncomputing.com/">device I really wanted</a
>,
but with twice the processor speed and one-third the price, it was hard to go 
with my heart when the med school packet that arrived today said a laptop was
required.  Of course, it goes without saying that at least <a 
href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/model_inspn_inspn_1100.htm">this
one</a> has a keyboard and DVD-ROM built in, along with an 802.11b card that
I can actually use in Linux.  (Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ll plan to put up
how that goes, as well.)  The notebook should arrive in about two weeks, just
about the time I&rsquo;m packing the rest of my computers for the big move.  If
I have a chance, I&rsquo;ll plan to put up a nice note about it.</p>
<p>The last decent news for today is that I may teach yet one more class
for the <a href="http://www.review.com">Princeton Review</a>.  Always nice to
make a little extra money&hellip;.</p>
<p>As for the bad stuff&mdash;really nothing.  Just stress about everything
that needed to be done for med school and finding an apartment (ha!).  So,
that&rsquo;s over (at least the living arrangements part), and I&rsquo;m 
going to go watch some <a href="http://www.thexfiles.com">X-Files</a>.</p>
