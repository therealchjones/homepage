            We&apos;ve got about 250 miles to go today, and we&apos;ll be at
our new home.  With any luck, we&apos;ll make that by early this
afternoon, get the keys, and be able to move everything in before
nightfall (okay, so this will actually require a <em>lot</em> of luck,
and the nightfall thing is really just a goal; it&apos;s not like <a
href="http://www.xfiles.com/episodes/season6/6x13.html">anything
bad</a> will happen if we don&apos;t make it in time).

<p>We get the truck for another few days and another few hundred
miles, so even though it seems to be a piece of crap we&apos;ll
probably try to get our money&apos;s worth&mdash;buying and carrying a
washer and dryer, maybe an air conditioning unit or two, generally
racing with all the other fifteen-foot moving vans&hellip; alright,
maybe not that last one.</p>

<p>Unpacking can&apos;t be nearly as much of a pain as packing was,
although we will be trying to fit about the same amount of belongings
into a little more than half as much space.  Still, it shouldn&apos;t
be too difficult to unpack quickly; at the worst, everything will be
unpacked and the house simply won&apos;t yet be pretty by the time <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/ksom.html">medical
school</a> starts next Monday.</p>

<p>That&apos;s right, I have one more week before I officially become
a medical student.  It&apos;s a fairly busy week, but I think it will
be a good one.  As I mentioned, we still have to unpack, I have a
barbecue at the medical school to attend and meet my &ldquo;big
sib&rdquo;, I probably need to start picking up supplies and making
sure all my loans come through, and I still need to decide if
we&apos;ll make <a
href="http://www.undersea.com/~kelsey/bbq2003/">Steve &amp;
Kelsey&apos;s keg party</a>.  But I&apos;ll essentially be done
driving (damn, that reminds me, I also have to get my new
driver&apos;s license), and that&apos;s worth it.</p>
