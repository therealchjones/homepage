          <div class="post-body">
            As I go &#39;round the interview trail for residency, I&#39;m slowly becoming accustomed (if not inured) to the headaches of frequent flight in the US.  I&#39;m rapidly building up my <a href="http://www.continental.com/">Continental</a> frequent flier miles, partly because those headaches seemed to be mildly decreased on that particular airline.  (For instance, they don&#39;t charge extra for meals or movies.)

<p>Still, most of the real annoyances are carrier-independent, and stem from what we&#39;ve come to call airport security.  <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/">Newsweek</a> had a nice editorial by Anna Quindlen a few weeks ago entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15562940/">Taking Off Your Shoes</a>&rdquo; that really hit home and nicely describes the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">TSA</a> as a prime example of &ldquo;government run amok&rdquo;, with incompetence and arbitrariness at its center.  Perhaps the conclusion that most rings both true and frightening: &ldquo;Osama bin Laden could get through the line if the name on his licens was the same as that on his ticket and he wasn&#39;t packing Oil of Olay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In any case, I haven&#39;t had any specific problems with security at the airport, as I check all my liquids (I don&#39;t think you can buy 3-ounce bottles of <a href="http://www.tigihaircare.com/us/products/">Bed Head</a>), I wear slip-off shoes, and am a lower-middle-class white male.  This despite the ridiculous range of electronics that accompany me on the trip.  To be honest, I wouldn&#39;t mind the privacy issues, either, if I didn&#39;t have to  wait in line.</p>

<p>Outside security, however, I still don&#39;t understand how sitting on a plane for five hours doing nothing productive whatsoever can make me so damn <em>exhausted</em>&hellip;.</p>
