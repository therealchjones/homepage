            Where to start?  No, this isn&apos;t some depressing &ldquo;call for help&rdquo; or anything, there&apos;s just been a lot since the last time I posted.  I&apos;m unofficially an MSII, since the year one comprehensive exam was a little over a week ago;  however, there&apos;s still a week or more before I find out if I officially passed.

<p>Lindsey starts a new job tomorrow!  She finally decided she&apos;d had enough of academia, and starts at <a href="http://www.wellpoint.com">WellPoint</a>, who (among other things) owns <a href="http://www.bluecrossca.com">BlueCross of California</a> and of seven other states, as an Actuarial Technician.  It&apos;s been big and stressful for her, but I&apos;m very proud.  Oh, and she&apos;ll bebringing in Phat Bank&trade;, too.</p>

<p>I got back last night from a quick <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org">AMA</a> meeting in Chicago.  I&apos;d never been outside O&apos;Hare before, so the city was a fun little experience.  However, I was on one of the convention committees, so I didn&apos;t get to see much of it.  I&apos;ll talk about the conference a little more later on, but for the moment the thing that keeps weighing on my mind is the fact that I caught a cold, probably out in the cold Chicago rain on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Bad time to be feeling like crap.  I&apos;m starting to bike again tomorrow, and it will be my first shift working on an asthma study in the emergency room. Further, this is the first full week working on a drug rep study myself and another student are doing with the Office of Continuing Medical Education, and I need to be doing a lot to get home into shape for the summer.  As always, way too many projects and not nearly enough time to do them.</p>

<p>And yet, always time to post here.</p>
