            No, I haven&apos;t failed out of med school&mdash;I&apos;m
referring to another semester down the tubes!  That&apos;s right,
I&apos;ve (unofficially) passed my first semester of medical
school&mdash;and, since <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/ksom.html">Keck</a> is
entirely pass-fail the first two years, that&apos;s all that matters.
(Another possible way of reading that sentence is &ldquo;I didn&apos;t
do particularly well, but I don&apos;t particularly care.&rdquo;)

<p>So now time for a little relaxation&mdash;<em>very</em> little,
from the outlook:  I&apos;m <em>really</em> close to being finished
with <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/linux/">InFiniT
GNU/Linux</a> 0.1.1, and I&apos;d like to release that today.  If I
don&apos;t, it won&apos;t be until at least 27 December, since Lindsey
and I will be at her mother&apos;s house in Colorado from tomorrow
until then.  Keep your fingers crossed I&apos;ll finish&mdash;with any
luck, I&apos;m running the last test right now.</p>

<p>I&apos;d also like to get a running start for next semester.
We&apos;re done with the &ldquo;Core Sciences&rdquo; section, and on
to individual organ systems.  The next couple of months (starting
bright and early on 5 January) is Hematology and Immunology.
We&apos;ll be doing Neurosciences for the two months after Spring
Break (which, amazingly, is the last week in February), and finish May
off with the musculoskeletal system.  After that is a week of
comprehensive exams (for the whole year&apos;s worth of material, I
think), so the last thing I need to be doing is cramming in the last
few days (as I&apos;ve done for the last several exams).  Don&apos;t
get me wrong&mdash;I&apos;ll be doing my best not to work my ass off,
but I wouldn&apos;t mind actually having a good reputation among the
faculty&hellip;</p>
