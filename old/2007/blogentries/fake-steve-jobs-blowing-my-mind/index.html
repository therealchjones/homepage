            I&#39;ve been a fan of <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Fake Steve Jobs</a> (partly because I&#39;m a fan of Real Steve Jobs) for some time, but I never expected to see a post like his <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/05/thoughts-for-holiday-weekend.html">recent one suggesting more drug use</a>.  Gist is that kids today are corporate automatons essentially because they learned to &ldquo;just say no&rdquo; to drugs (oh, and sex, too).

<p>In fact, the only problem I have with his entire argument is that I <em>don&#39;t</em> know a lot of just-say-no-ers.  One may argue it&#39;s due to a large portion of my extended education being in southern California (or the portion that wasn&#39;t in California being in graduate mathematics), but I&#39;ve met few enough people that chose to say no to the occasional joint or the occasional relationship-free romp.  Sure, harder stuff (in both those senses) was rarely partaken, but &ldquo;drug-free&rdquo; was never one of the more appropriate descriptions of my chosen crew.</p>

<p>And yes, that applies to those I hung out with in medical school, as well;  and no, not just the anesthesiologists.  My drugs of choice may be legal (and advertised, and encouraged socially), but plenty of my colleagues (and friends) made different choices, and I&#39;m not entirely certain that mine was the &ldquo;better&rdquo; one overall.  I may have been in a committed relationship the entire time, but that again didn&#39;t keep several of my colleagues (and friends) from enjoying each others&#39; company without worry of awkwardness when back in the hospital.  No, we&#39;re not talking <span class="longtitle">Grey&#39;s Anatomy</span> here, but it&#39;s not a 50&#39;s hospital drama, either.</p>

<p>What&#39;s my point?  Well, mainly just to link to the always fascinating FSJ.  Beyond that, maybe I just felt like ranting a bit about the cloistered life too many live nowadays.  Oh, I&#39;m still looking forward to the move to Kansas City and the possibility of being cloistered there&mdash;but it&#39;s a self-cloistering, a cloistering by choice, rather than being convinced by someone else that I need to avoid &ldquo;the evils&rdquo; of the world.  Mostly, it&#39;s just the thrill of getting away from the craphole that is Los Angeles.</p>
