            I meant to blog this a while ago, but I&#39;m finally just sitting at work waiting for a trauma and unable to call Lindsey since I forgot my cell phone at home.  I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I finally have nothing better to do, so I might as well blog.

<p>Upon my arrival in Jacksonville for a &ldquo;trauma surgery&rdquo; rotation (more on that some other time), I got a little bored and decided to check out the local electronics stores.  Just for some browsing, of course, but still wanted to look for anything interesting.  Went to Best Buy first, then to Circuit City&mdash;helpfully enough, within a city block of one another.  Looked around at all the flashing lights, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iPod</a> accessories, movies, and so forth, and decided to see if there were any interesting games worth playing.  I&#39;ve brought my PowerBook with me, so I headed to the end of the software section where I remember <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a> software being.</p>

<p>Except it wasn&#39;t.  I asked salesmen, and they practically snickered.  No, there&#39;s no Apple software in either store, no hardware in either store despite the recent <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/">ad campaign</a>, and no indication that the stores are even interested.  (In all fairness, there was recently <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2020">a note that Circuit City may be changing that</a>.)  It boggles the mind.  Maybe it&#39;s just Jacksonville, or just the South, but maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;the Apple campaign isn&#39;t working as well as I might like.</p>

<p>Oh, and for anyone who&#39;s wondering, there is a <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/stjohnstowncenter/week/20060910.html">Jacksonville Apple Store</a>.</p>
