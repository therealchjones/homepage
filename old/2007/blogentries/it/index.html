            Almost a month, in fact, since the last time I checked in here.  Lots has happenned.  I&apos;m not sure why, but I haven&apos;t yet given up on doing as well
 as possible in school, instead of &ldquo;just passing&rdquo;&mdash;despite &ldquo;just passing&rdquo; hematology, despite the extra work I put into it.  We&apos;re on neurosciences now, and it&apos;s going well so far&mdash;but we&apos;ve 
only had a week of it, and that&apos;s about when I thought heme was going well,
 too.

<p>I had a little server downtime this morning;  Los Angeles Department of Water
 and Power decided they would work on the electricity for my neighborhood for a 
couple of hours.  They were nice enough to let me know about, but woke me this morning ten minutes or so before it happenned.  No big deal, but when I turned the server back on, I got a nice yell like a banshee from it.  &ldquo;Hard drive failure&rdquo; I assumed, which wouldn&apos;t have been a huge problem since I hadn&apos;t changed anything in more than 24 hours and everything would have been 
backed up, but it turned out to be the CPU fan.  So, instead of running out for 
a new fan, this is now running on one of the other machines.  100MHz faster, three times the RAM, and a Pentium II instead of a Pentium MMX.  Oh, sure, it&apos;s still crap, but I didn&apos;t have to shell out for the extra fan, and I&apos;ll be able to use the i586 for <a href="/infinit">Infinit</a> development, so that will finally be i586-compatible.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I didn&apos;t announce (on here) the new version I put out
 over spring break, <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux 0.2</a>.  It&apos;s far from perfect, but it&apos;s much closer.  Lots more work in the coming weeks:  I&apos;d like to release 1.0 before April 1, but I&apos;ll 
settle for 0.3.  Keep checking back.</p>

<p>Lindsey and I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331953/">Club Dread</a> (horrible) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/">50 First Dates</a> (surprisingly good) today.  I actually recommend the Adam Sandler&mdash;just
 as good as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120888/">The Wedding Singer</a>, but unfortunately without the nostalgia.  Please, in the name of movie watchers everywhere, don&apos;t see Club Dread.  Broken Lizard really didn&apos;t seem
 to get it this time around.  Check out their <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/">Super Troopers</a> instead.</p>

<p>That&apos;s it for the moment.  Stay tuned.</p>
