            I won&#39;t bore you with the details of our first <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/departments/family_medicine/education/clinical_medicine/">ICM</a> day this year;  it was mostly logistical and we
didn&#39;t see any patients.  I also won&#39;t bore you with the details of
how it all came about, but I was required to change ICM groups (no, nothing
bad, just more logistical stuff).  As I mentioned before, I really liked the
group I was placed in for the year, but the new group is great also.  Further,
it led to the opportunity to have Dr. Paul Willis for our ICM instructor.

<p>Okay, I have to admit that this is exciting.  Dr. Willis is very cool, and
has had some interesting life experiences.  He grew up maybe twenty miles from
where I was raised in Florida, and has worked for Disney and a computer company,
and designed sprinklers for skyscrapers.  What most people in our class are
amazed at, though (maybe because I keep mentioning it), is that he&#39;s also
the on-site physician at Edison Field (where the <a
href="http://anaheim.angels.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=ana">Angels</a>
play, (and, yeah, he wears a World Series ring), <a
href="http://www.staplescenter.com">the Staples Center</a>, and a couple other
venues around LA.  We&#39;re already planning on attending multiple events over
the year.  Very cool.</p>

<p>The most interesting to me, however, is that Dr. Willis would actually be
one of the coolest ICM instructors I&#39;ve met even without his current
positions.  Am I excited to go to baseball games and concerts?  Absolutely.
But he&#39;s also already demonstrated a great attitude and an expectation of
mutual respect.  (Not to mention, from some of the notes I&#39;ve found online
from patients, a great bedside manner.)  But hey, I&#39;m just thrilled to have
any medical instructor who knows what machine language is.</p>
