            Well, almost done with the summer.  Surprisingly, that&#39;s a Good Thing&trade;; the summer in the Emergency Department has been fairly disappointing.  I tend to sit outside a single room for a few hours at a time (often reading <a href="http://www.emergencyekg.com">Dale Dubin</a>&#39;s <span
class="longtitle">Rapid Interpretation of EKG&#39;s</span> or the new survival book I got on clearance for four bucks, just in case I fall in a lake);  it&#39;s pretty much just sitting&mdash;I have to keep an eye on the asthma booth just in case someone comes in, but no one has in the several weeks I&#39;ve been doing this.

<p>My other research project (the one I&#39;m getting <em>paid</em> for) is going a little bit better.  We&#39;ve been able to reach nearly every department of USC that has any significant number of residents, and myself and Jennifer Malin, my research partner, will begin visiting meetings next week to distribute surveys.  That should be fun&hellip; oh, sorry, that was supposed to come out sarcastically.</p>

<p>With any luck, though, I&#39;ll basically have 17 July&ndash;1 August away from school.  I may have to go to those meetings, but since classes start (I think) on 2 August, I&#39;d rather just relax, do some <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing">computer stuff</a>, and watch some movies.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>Just a couple of other quick notes:  <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux</a> 0.4 is almost complete.  There&#39;s a simple feature I want to add (booting from an initrd), and then it&#39;s just building for a few days on the slow computer.  This may be the last time I build it (slowly) to be i586-compatible, since I think I&#39;ll go back to using that old machine as my server.  I recently read <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-openbsd">an interesting review of OpenBSD 3.5</a> over at <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">DistroWatch.com</a>, so I think that after this Infinit build I&#39;m going to try that out for a while.  I&#39;m (probably) not going to be abandoning Infinit, but <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> looks pretty sweet.</p>

<p>One of OpenBSD&#39;s relatives, <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>, is the operating system run by a service I&#39;ve recently rediscovered, <a href="http://www.freeshell.org">SDF Public Access Unix System</a>.  This is an outstanding service which offers a free shell account to <em>anyone</em>;  for a buck you can validate your account (I did) and configure it to your liking, or even throw up a home page (I mean post, not vomit).  This is the sort of stuff I actually <em>like</em> to support.</p>

<p>Oh, cool medical tales!  The first:  a week or so ago, interesting case came
in:  woman was down at Women&#39;s and Children&#39;s Hospital (part of LAC+USC
Medical Center, but not General Hospital) being interviewed by physicians, when
they decided she was having a stroke.  This was fairly reasonable, considering she seemed unable to control one side of her face, was drooling, and unable to speak clearly.  They immediately sent her to the ER&mdash;where it was discovered that her cranial vessels were just fine, and she had spontaneously dislocated her jaw.  Just goes to show you what happens when you jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>The second, and on a more personal note:  I&#39;ve been having a bit of forearm and hand pain on my left for a few weeks;  I had broken my wrist when I was a teenager, so thought it might be that causing some problems.  I went to the doctor on Wednesday, and, cool stuff, I get to see a hand surgeon!  The likely diagnosis is a <a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/fact/thr_report.cfm?Thread_ID=183">ganglion cyst</a>.  It is similar to, but presents fairly different from, carpal tunnel syndrome (which is more frightening to me, as there&#39;s not much to do about that, and I don&#39;t want to stop coding).  I&#39;m definitely going to see the surgery myself (I&#39;m hoping they won&#39;t just aspirate it), and I&#39;m going to try to get pictures or a video tape.  Now I just need to review my dorsal hand anatomy in case the surgeon pimps me while I&#39;m under the knife&hellip;</p>

<p>Finally, as I always say at just about any transition (beginning of a new semester, first of the month, Wednesday, whatever), I&#39;m going to start dieting 
again and trying to post more Real Soon Now&reg;&hellip; and I <em>mean</em> it 
this time.  No, seriously&mdash;you just watch.</p>
