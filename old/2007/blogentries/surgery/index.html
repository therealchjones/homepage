          <div class="post-body">
            &hellip;almost surprisingly good, in fact.  Our ICM group visited
<a href="http://www.childrenshospitalla.org">Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles</a> yesterday.  Despite the fact that I&apos;m fairly certain
there should be an apostrophe in the name, we had a remarkably good
visit.  I have to admit I haven&apos;t been seriously considering
surgery, probably because I don&apos;t tend to appreciate the
stereotypical closed-mindedness of surgeons, and I like to feel like
more than an overpaid mechanic.  But as we watched a hand
reconstruction on a child with <a
href="http://www.apert.org/apert.htm">Apert Syndrome</a>, I was simply
fascinated.  In some sense, I actually saw the beauty in the way the
tasks were done&mdash;lots of planning out exactly what would be done,
and adaptation to unexpected consequences with ease.  Oh, and they
closed to <a
href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=Afk2gtq2ztu47">Led
Zeppelin IV</a>.

<p>So it&apos;s anyone&apos;s game at this point.  Speaking of which,
I agreed to play what essentially amounts to intramural football
(maybe I&apos;m missing UF already); the only problem is that I just
learned it&apos;s two-hand touch, with no linemen, and only passing
plays can advance the ball.  Um, let&apos;s see; no defensive offense,
no tackling, and no running game?  What part of this is football?</p>

<p>It&apos;s actually a symptom of a much wider condition I&apos;ve
noticed here&mdash;there are quite a few people who are more ambitious
than I, and I&apos;ve noticed that in large part they&apos;re really
not entitled to be ambitious.  They make rules that suit them, they
arrange schedules that suit them&mdash;all of which they&apos;re
entitled to do&mdash;and then they expect everyone else to be happy
about them.  Oh, sure, that&apos;s coming from someone being annoyed
by their ambition, but I&apos;ve gotten over the need to apologize for
being annoyed.  We&apos;ll see how they handle getting slapped down.
(No, that&apos;s not a physical threat.)</p>

<p>In any case, I&apos;m fairly certain that the great comiserator
will be this afternoon&mdash;we&apos;re having a practice exam, which
the second years have apparently mentioned is a great deal harder than
the actual exams we&apos;ll have in three weeks.  Sure, I studied a
little, but I&apos;m not stressing about it&mdash;I&apos;m more
worried that I&apos;ll be annoyed at bitching about the exam than
I&apos;m worried about doing poorly on the exam itself.</p>
