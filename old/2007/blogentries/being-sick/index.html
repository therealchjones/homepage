            &hellip;really blows.  I&apos;m not one of those future docs who has had a
lot of experience with personal illness and therefore wants to eradicate
sickness or at least help ease suffering;  I honestly just like the
adrenaline and problem-solving.  Maybe that&apos;d be different if I had a
greater history of being sick.  As it stands, I really don&apos;t get sick
all that often;  perhaps for that very reason, I don&apos;t handle it well
when I do.  I&apos;ve been &ldquo;sick&rdquo; for about a week, but that&apos;s
been normal head cold-type stuff.  Yesterday was horrible&mdash;abdominal, er, &ldquo;involvement&rdquo;, and I&apos;ll leave it at that.  I essentially sat
on the sofa and moaned all day.

<p>Not that that sounds so bad itself;  as Lindsey pointed out, the thing I didn&apos;t like about it is that I <em>had</em> to do that.  If I just felt like sitting around and watching TV, that&apos;d have been fine.  But as it stands, yesterday (and recovery today) has been horrible.</p>

<p>So, back to life as usual (hopefully) tomorrow, and back to the ER on Monday.  About the only benefit to the last couple of days off has been that I finally sat through <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/">Chinatown</a>, by Roman Polanski.  I&apos;ve really got to stop watching these great old movies&mdash;they&apos;re admirable, but just not entertaining.  Therefore, I will refrain from rating it.  Ah, well.  I think we&apos;re going to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/">Dodgeball</a> tomorrow;  I somehow doubt &ldquo;admirable&rdquo; will describe it, but it does look funny.</p>
