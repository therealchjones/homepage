<h2>Blogger Update</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve done a pretty good job so far of updating the site to use <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, but there&#39;s still lots to do.  The <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/medschool/">med school</a>, <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/archives.html">archives</a>, and <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/links.html">links</a> pages are still using the old format until I put the work into fitting them into the Blogger system somehow.  I&#39;ve still got about 170 posts to convert over to the new system, and then (probably) plenty of editing and formatting to make everything look just right.  Still, it&#39;s gone faster than I&#39;d expected.</p>

<p>This will, however, probably be my last post for some time, at least until the <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/archives.html">archives</a> page is somehow automatically-generated and all those posts are converted manually.  For the moment, each new page I add has to be put into Blogger and my old system independently, and that&#39;s a bit annoying.  Still, keep checking back, and please <a href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">email me</a> with any issues you encounter or suggestions for better formatting or behavior.  Thanks!</p>

<h2>Now Using Blogger</h2>

<p>Thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> (which is, of course, in turn thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>), this site is now <em>significantly</em> easier to maintain.  This is following my satisfaction at having converted my <a href="http://www.christianjones.md/">ChristianJones.MD</a> site to use Blogger;  that said, this one will take quite a lot more work, if only because of the much higher number of posts to move over.</p>

<p>Blogger&#39;s not perfect.  I don&#39;t yet have a good way to distinguish automatically between &ldquo;posted at&rdquo; and &ldquo;last edited at&rdquo; times, and I&#39;d like the option to have some simple markup-less input nicely converted into well-formed XHTML.  That said, they&#39;ve put a decent product together, and I&#39;m happy to shill for it, at least until I come up with my own alternative.</p>

<p>So expect some more changes over the next several days (weeks, months, years,&hellip;).  I&#39;ll be manually transferring most of the posts, and there are quite a few.  Thanks for reading&mdash;I&#39;ll do my best to keep writing.</p>

<h2>I&#39;ve Survived Medicine</h2>

<p>General Medicine I is complete.  It&#39;s the first clerkship I&#39;ve
completed, so I&#39;m pretty happy.  I&#39;ve also got the weekend off
before starting the dreaded Ob/Gyn on Monday.  Lindsey and I will try to
catch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377107/">Proof</a> tomorrow, 
and I&#39;m going to try to finish the latest Harry Potter (finally).  All 
in all, nice and relaxing.</p>

<p>Medicine actually wasn&#39;t too bad&mdash;I&#39;ve still had enough
time to catch most of the new television shows, and I&#39;ve also been 
taking some time to work on <a 
href="http://www.christianjones.md/">ChristianJones.MD</a>, my 
&ldquo;professional&rdquo; site.  I&#39;m almost finished switching it to
the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> engine, which is going
even better than I&#39;d hoped.  There are some things I don&#39;t care for
about Blogger, but all in all it&#39;s been a quite positive change.  Check
out the site sometime, and <a href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">let me know</a>
what you think.</p>

<p>For now, though, it&#39;s back to relaxing.  Have a nice weekend,
everyone!</p>

<h2>Rumors of my departure have been greatly exaggerated</h2>

<p>Lindsey and I went out for lunch today, and I had the lucky
chance to run into Chris, a friend of mine from med school. 
Turns out there are some rumors going around that I left 
school&mdash;rumors which I&#39;ll start to lay to rest here by
saying that I haven&#39;t.  Oh, I seriously thought about it,
but ended up just taking off most of my first rotation;  two
days of surgery was a rough start on me mentally, so I switched
my schedule around, had almost six weeks of &ldquo;vacation&rdquo;,
and am now done with two weeks of my internal medicine 
clerkship.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going reasonably well&mdash;I don&#39;t have as much
free time as I&#39;d like, but that&#39;s to be expected.  I&#39;m
much more &ldquo;with it&rdquo; now.  If you don&#39;t see me
around school, it&#39;s only because these first three weeks of
IM are my outpatient rotation&mdash;I&#39;ll be back in the 
hospital just after labor day.  See you then!</p>

<h2>Internal Medicine</h2>

<p>I&#39;m spending the next two and a half weeks at a private physician&#39;s
office in Alhambra, working hard for this half of my Internal Medicine
rotation.  The schedule&#39;s not a killer, but I&#39;m still So Very
Tired&reg;.  My weekends are off, though, so hopefully I&#39;ll have 
the time and inclination to post a bit more then&hellip;.</p>

<h2>More power!</h2>

<p>Don&#39;t want to write much (there&#39;s <em>so</em> much to talk 
about), but I did want to apologize for any downtime and note that there
may be more.</p>

<p><a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8662257/">Southern California is in a
state of &ldquo;power emergency&rdquo;</a>, according to MSNBC.  Basically,
the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; power companies have several power plants
out of commission at the moment, and they can&#39;t keep up with record
demand&mdash;a bit of which my two air conditioners, home entertainment
system, and twelve computer probably have contributed.  Our house has had
(at least) three blackouts in the last 48 hours, and I wouldn&#39;t be
surprised to have more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m running relatively blind&mdash;most of my work is currently
on my Mac mini and an LCD or on my OpenBSD laptop.  I&#39;ve also got the
server, a couple of routers and access points, and the DSL modem all 
running.  That&#39;s really not bad as far as power drain goes, as I have 
all my other machines, including the power-hungry Windows computer, 
completely off at the moment.  More energy is going toward simply staying
cool, as it&#39;s <em>damn</em> hot here in LA.</p>

<p>The one nice thing is that this situation&#39;s given me a chance to
test my UPS systems.  They&#39;ve held up great, even though all the
machines I mentioned before (except the laptop) are hooked up to only
two of them.  They&#39;re consumer models from <a 
href="http://www.belkin.com/">Belkin</a> that have been on sale at 
one point or another, and they haven&#39;t turned off spontaneously 
yet.  (In each of the prior outages, I shut down the connected computers
and turned off the battery backups myself.)</p>

<p>The other lesson here, of course, is that I <em>really</em> need
a form of off-grid renewable energy of fairly large magnitude&mdash;or
somehow tap into one of the hospital&#39;s generators.</p>

<h2>On Hiatus</h2>

<p>I&#39;m on hiatus&mdash;from school, posting here, and pretty much all
of The Outside World&reg;&mdash;until further notice, probably somewhere
between one week and one month.  I&#39;m still alive, but this site is
pretty near the bottom of my list of priorities for the moment.  I&#39;ll
be back, but don&#39;t hold your breath.</p>

<h2>Brief update</h2>

<p>It&#39;s been a pretty long week, so I&#39;ll just say that (as far as
I know) the USMLE Step 1 went no better and no worse than I&#39;d 
expected, and it&#39;ll be about six weeks until I get the results.  By
that time, I&#39;ll be just about finished with my Surgery rotation.
For the last few days, I&#39;ve been alternately relaxing and doing a load
of those errands you save up for such times, and I&#39;m already pretty
tired and in no way ready to head back to school on Tuesday.  Hopefully, 
though, it&#39;ll be a fun weekend&mdash;Lindsey and I are headed down
to the <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.com/wap/">San Diego Wild Animal
Park</a> tomorrow and staying in Escondido overnight.  We&#39;ll be back 
for some fun and relaxing on Sunday (when we&#39;re likely to catch <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">War of the Worlds</a>), the
typical 4th-of-July-barbecuing on Monday, and then 3rd-year orientation 
is on Tuesday.  Sure, lots of work to do before then, but I&#39;m just
going to try to relax.  Still, expect more updates as I can&hellip;</p>

<h2>Test Tomorrow</h2>

<p>In less than 24 hours, I&#39;ll be done with (at least my first shot at)
the <a href="http://www.usmle.org/">USMLE</a> Step 1.  I&#39;ve basically
taken today off;  Lindsey and I watched <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117381/">Primal Fear</a> and a lot of
TV.  Nice and relaxing, though I think it&#39;s safe to say this is the 
most nervous I&#39;ve ever been about an exam.  (Actually, I&#39;m not 
positive of that&mdash;my last couple of exams have been pretty 
nerve-racking.  It&#39;s like my confidence has been shot since failing 
GI.  Nah, that couldn&#39;t be it.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had time to do just a bit of computer work in the last 
couple of days, and I got to do my semi-annual <a
href="http://www.frys.com/">Fry&#39;s</a> shopping spree today.  Lots of
great stuff and great deals&mdash;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll spend the next
week or so putting everything together.</p>

<p>On the computer/med school front, I&#39;ve also had the opportunity to
help a couple of friends make the transition from USC&#39;s exceedingly
poor web mail service to <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a>.
They seemed to appreciate the assistance, so in anticipation (and the hope)
of more people doing the same, I&#39;ve made up a little <a
href="/~chjones/medicine/medschool/computing.html#gmail">guide to using Gmail instead of
USC Email</a>.  It&#39;s likely to be renovated (in format, not content)
soon, with a reformatting of a lot of my pages already in progress, but 
it should still be accessible at that address.</p>

<p>On a final computing note, I&#39;ve heard about the <a
href="http://www.advocacydev.org/">AdvocacyDev Conference</a> being held
in Oakland a couple of weeks from now, a meeting of using Free and Open
Source Software in politics and activism.  This sounds like an absolutely
thrilling thing, and I&#39;d love to take part in something like this, but
that&#39;ll be the first weekend of my surgery rotation, so no real luck
there.  Oh, well.  Something to think about for next year.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s about it for now.  Still wondering if I&#39;ll feel great
relief tomorrow or be crying in bed for a few days&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Five more days</h2>

<p>Five more, then I&#39;m (with any luck at all) done with two years
of med school.  Half a doctor;  I can only hope the next two (and
residency, and life afterwards) are at least marginally better.  In the
meantime, though, it&#39;s all about going over flashcards and listening
to some Goljan audio reviews.  I&#39;m starting to randomly think
about medical things when I&#39;m not studying, which is ridiculously
unpleasant, but is probably a good sign.  I&#39;ve never been big on
thinking about &ldquo;work&rdquo; when I&#39;m not working, but it&#39;s
happening at the moment, so I suppose I should just go with it.</p>

<p>A couple little interesting things I read about today:  there&#39;s a <a
href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/22/1921203">Slashdot
review of Darknet</a>, a (relatively) new book subtitled <span
class="longtitle">Hollywood&#39;s War Against the Digital Generation</span>.
It turns out the journalist who wrote it has a blog at <a
href="http://www.darknet.com/">Darknet.com</a>, and he&#39;s got some
very interesting thoughts and anecdotes about copyright and fair use.  (I
particularly like&mdash;and will probably start using&mdash;his phrase
&ldquo;copyright cartel&rdquo;.  Might pick up the book, if I ever have
the time and inclination at the same moment, but you can bet I&#39;ll start
linking to the blog on a regular basis.</p>

<p>On a marginally related note, there&#39;s been talk&mdash;even though
the story&#39;s almost a month old&mdash;about a &ldquo;researcher&rdquo;
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39199794,00.htm">cracking
Windows Genuine Advantage</a>.  It&#39;s not particularly impressive, 
actually, since it basically involves just using a number generated on
a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; installation of <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Microsoft Windows</a> to use
products on an &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; installation.  (<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/FAQ.aspx">Windows 
Genuine Advantage</a> is the program Microsoft will soon begin using
to verify your installation of Windows is legal, and then let you
download patches and add-on software based on that.)</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t have moral qualms about Microsoft releasing
patches and add-ons only to &ldquo;legal&rdquo; installations.  I think
it&#39;s a poor choice for them and for the Net at large, but I have my
single legal license, and am happy to use free software for my other
PCs, so they&#39;re welcome&mdash;from a legal and moral 
standpoint&mdash;to add functionality only available to purchasing 
customers.  That&#39;s fine.  What I&#39;m not okay with is that 
every time I download such a piece of software, or have to reinstall
Windows, or whatever, <em>they get that information</em>.  IANAL, but 
I&#39;m fairly certain Microsoft&#39;s EULA doesn&#39;t include anything
about me informing them every time I perform computer maintenance, and
that seems like the next step.  Mandatory bug reports.  Obtaining
permission before changing configuration.  I&#39;m not happy with that.
So, despite the lack of technical impressario in the WGA workaround, it
could still be useful.  Or, you know, maybe not.</p>

<h2>Privacy be damned</h2>

<p>Just a couple of quick notes today, then it&#39;s back to studying.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a geek, and very slightly paranoid.  I&#39;m supposed to care
about privacy issues, and I&#39;m reminded of this every so often, mostly
to the derision of my friends and colleagues.  People on <a
href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> (mind you, I&#39;m in no way
suggesting these are people I&#39;m trying to emulate) rant on about the
problems with grocery &ldquo;club cards&rdquo; and such.  The essential 
problem, they say, is that it&#39;s not reasonable to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo;
of the information being gathered by the programs, since they&#39;re the only way to get a reasonable price on groceries.  So I was half annoyed
with myself when I bought some over-the-counter loratadine at the local
SavOn a few days ago, applied for a club card to get a significant discount,
and <em>didn&#39;t</em> write incorrect information on the form.  I&#39;m
supposed to care, right?  Yet it didn&#39;t even occur to me to falsify the
info until I&#39;d filled out the form and left the store.</p>

<p>(Don&#39;t even get me started on the hoops I had to jump through to get
a hospital ID badge.  Presumably the school already can prove I&#39;m who
I say I am, but here we go giving out driver license numbers, social 
security numbers, and even <em>fingerprints</em>.  Gah.)</p>

<p>Okay, to try and make up for that a bit, I&#39;m writing just a short bit
about privacy policies and information collection.  You know those policy
statements we regularly get from banks, credit card companies, and so forth,
describing the limits they go to not to archive information about you, to
protect it from others, etc.?  Well, it turns out those are all but 
meaningless.  The information, apparently, passes through a number of
other systems, some of which seem to have fewer scruples about how they
manage where you just spent that $19.95 on the web.  This weekend, it was
announced that one of these providers (CardSystem Solutions) was hacked 
into, and a brief scare about the exposure of info of 40 million credit card 
users exposed was announced.  Now <a 
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8286132/">the company admits it wasn&#39;t
supposed to be storing the information</a>, yet we&#39;ve heard no 
announcement of an investigation or lawsuit to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>Part of that may be because the government&#39;s a bit busy with similar
matters closer to them.  It turns out <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8293096/">the TSA and its contractors have
been keeping databases of passenger data</a> even after they&#39;ve been
specifically told by Congress not to.  Yep, the government <em>is</em> 
keeping tabs on you&mdash;but it&#39;s not the FBI or CIA, it&#39;s the
people who can&#39;t even get you through a metal detector in less than
two hours.  Nice to see who has &ldquo;secured&rdquo; my privacy.</p>

<h2>Year III, Baby!</h2>

<p>(Yes, I&#39;m aware I can&#39;t really pull off saying &ldquo;baby&rdquo;
like that, but I&#39;m excited, baby!)</p>

<p>Got my Year II Comprehensive Exam results today&mdash;I actually did 
<em>well</em>.  Not just passing, mind you, but even above average! 
(I&#39;m as shocked as you are.)  Wow.  Almost hard to believe that 
I&#39;m half a doctor at this point.  Technically, the only remaining thing
I have to do before I can begin Year III is take the USMLE Step 1, but I
only have to <em>take</em> it before the beginning of third year, not 
necessarily <em>pass</em> it.  (To be honest, though, my surprising 
performance on this test has convinced me that, in fact, I <em>can</em>
pass the boards, and may even do okay.)</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve got a week to finish boning up on everything I was 
supposed to learn over the last two years.  I&#39;ve got forty hours of
audio to listen to, (only) about a hundred and forty pages of notes to
review, and somewhere in the neighborhood of four hundred flashcards to 
memorize&mdash;oh, and I need to make some for pharmacology.  Not bad for 
a week&#39;s studying, eh?</p>

<p>So, no real fun for a week, but I&#39;m having pizza, beer, and 
champagne (hey, who said we&#39;re not classy?) tonight, and I&#39;ve
already seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman
Begins</a>, so I&#39;m all set until <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">War of the Worlds</a>
comes out next week.  (Oh, by the way, Batman was good;  easily the
best since the 1992 <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/">Batman</a>, but I&#39;m not
exactly sure which I liked better.  <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/">Christian Bale</a> does
brooding well, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474/">Michael
Keaton</a> pulls off the dark humor better.  Three stars;  worth a viewing
in the theater, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to wait for the DVD.)</p>

<h2>Treo 650</h2>

<p>After a great deal of thinking about it, I bought a <a
href="http://www.palmone.com/">pa1mOne</a> Treo today, the 
&ldquo;smartphone&rdquo; that&#39;s a Palm OS PDA and cell phone in one.
I got a great deal on it, and it&#39;s been hinted that we&#39;ll need a 
Palm (or some other PDA that runs <a 
href="http://www.epocrates.com/">ePocrates</a>) for next year.  I did a 
lot of research, and decided to conglomerate the two devices.</p>

<p>Problem is, the thing isn&#39;t all that great.  I&#39;m returning it.
There are a <em>huge</em> number of things that my Zaurus does that the
Treo doesn&#39;t do&mdash;or at least doesn&#39;t do free and/or 
easily&mdash;and the interface just isn&#39;t what I&#39;d like.  It is
a nice cell phone, but as far as PDAs go, it seems that I&#39;m just 
paying for it being a &ldquo;Palm&rdquo; because it&#39;s a 
&ldquo;standard&rdquo;, not because it does anything special.  And paying
a lot, I might add&mdash;it&#39;s just not worth $300 to $400.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m returning it, and it looks like it&#39;s back to the Zaurus.
That&#39;s not bad, but I&#39;ve never been satisfied with certain aspects
of the Zaurus.  (The PIM, actually&mdash;all the non-PIM things are great,
but what&#39;s the use of a PDA without a PIM?)  I don&#39;t like any of 
ROMs I long ago learned to install on the device to replace the default 
one.  So it looks like I&#39;m back to making a Linux 
distribution&mdash;interesting how these things come back to haunt you.
Let&#39;s see what we end up with, in all my copious free time.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I&#39;ll take off a couple of hours to see <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman Begins</a> with a 
couple of my friends.  If it&#39;s as decently dark as it could be, I
should be happy.</p>

<h2>epguides.com</h2>

<p>Just a follow up on a previous complaints about the change at TvTome: 
I&#39;m now using <a href="http://epguides.com/">epguides.com</a> for the
basic purposes I mentioned in that entry, namely determining where an episode
with a particular title falls into the series.  It&#39;s far from perfect, as
all the links to episodes point to the old TvTome page for that episode, and
many (or maybe all) don&#39;t work correctly.  There&#39;s also no news or
list of available and upcoming DVDs for most shows.  The biggest worry,
however, is that the site seems to be fairly closely affiliated with TvTome
(or TV.com), and it&#39;s not clear how long it will be around or how 
often it&#39;s updated.</p>

<p>No, nothing important, just more complaining.  On the good side of TV,
though, <a
href="http://psc.disney.go.com/abcnetworks/toondisney/">Toon Disney</a> has
started showing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112196/">The Tick</a>
most nights.  Excellent&mdash;check your local listings.  It&#39;s not
really mentioned anywhere on the site, but the TiVo seems to think it&#39;s
on every night at 8 PM (Pacific).  If you haven&#39;t watched this show, and
want to see one of the places that the not-just-for-kids animation thing
started, check it out.</p>

<h2>Blogging and Journalism&mdash;the new verbiage</h2>

<p>There&#39;s a new <a 
href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/14/1651215">discussion on
Slashdot about how much blogs suck</a>.  Most of the topics stem from one of
two ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blogs may or may not be replacing traditional media.</li>
<li>Most blogs are absolutely useless to anyone other than the author, if
that.</li>
</ul>

<p>One writer, in reference to the second point, had what may be <a
href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=152694&amp;cid=12814897">the best
description I&#39;ve read of the difference between a &ldquo;blog&rdquo; and
a &ldquo;journal&rdquo;</a>&mdash;the relevant summary is: <q>At least 
to my mind, a "journal" is an online diary, intended primarily for yourself 
and your friends. A "blog" is a soapbox or editorial page directed at the 
outside world. The difference is the size of the target audience.</q>.</p>

<p>The only issue I have with this is that it ignores the root of the 
word &ldquo;journalism&rdquo;, which is most often used to describe traditional
media.  Still, I think it&#39;s particularly clear that this is an important
distinction.  What I&#39;m writing is a journal&mdash;I honestly don&#39;t
expect anyone other than my acquaintances to care what&#39;s written here, and
quite possibly not even then.  I may make editiorial rants from time to time,
some of which may even be topical, none of which should be considered 
newsworthy&mdash;this site&#39;s more cathartic than informative, I have no
doubt.</p>

<p>Why does <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> need to archive
what I thought about the Repro exam, or why I don&#39;t really like LA?  It
doesn&#39;t, and I can only barely imagine anyone finding it useful&mdash;but 
it&#39;s still <em>information</em>, it still should be accessible, and if it
makes searching for relevant items more difficult, then perhaps it&#39;s the
search technology that needs to change.  If it were a matter of somehow tagging
a site or page as &ldquo;editorial&rdquo;, I&#39;d be happy to do so.  Come to
think of it, maybe that&#39;s the next step for the &ldquo;priority&rdquo;
tag in <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/">Google 
Sitemaps</a>.  I can even imagine the new query:</p>

<code>
(openbsd OR netbsd) "cd audio" priority:+0.7

<h2>TvTome is dead</h2>

<p>A few weeks back, CNET acquired TvTome, which was an excellent resource for
TV watchers who were a bit anal about it.  Personally, I found it great for
cataloging anything I downloaded from the TiVo.  Alas, it is no more.  CNET
has apparently changed the name (and URL) to TV.com, and changed the format
into one that makes it inordinately harder for me to use.  No longer do half
of my &ldquo;Episode List&rdquo; bookmarks work, and those that do take me
to an area that lists different seasons on different pages, with no clear
way to change this.  Want to find out which episode of <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/">The Simpsons</a> is entitled
&ldquo;Marge be not Proud&rdquo;?  Well, now it seems you already have to
know that it&#39;s in season 7, or browse through all sixteen until you find
it by hand.  (For this specific show, I&#39;ll now be using <a
href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/ql.html">The Simpsons Archive Episode
QuickList</a> instead, but that&#39;s not really the point.)</p>

<p>So, yeah, they changed a site with a huge userbase to actually get rid of
what some people (like me) consider features, made it look nicer, and broke
at least one element of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/">W3C Style Guide</a> (&ldquo;<a
href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs don&#39;t 
change</a>&rdquo;).  They&#39;ve flash-ified it, and basically made the site
all but useless to me.  You&#39;d think I&#39;d be used to the corporate
annexation of the web, right?</p>

<p>Maybe the problem is that this isn&#39;t always what happens.  A few years
ago, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> bought <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>.  The biggest change I noted was that 
after several months imdb.org stopped working, and you had to go to imdb.com
instead.  Since then, IMDb has added features, but the basic layout has
remained the same;  even the links I have from around 2000 still work.  (IMDb
did change their address style at one point, but that was well before the
Amazon takeover.)  It seems like a no-brainer:  buy something successful,
make small changes to avoid alienating those who made it successful and in
the hopes of attracting others.</p>

<p>For better or worse, it&#39;s not all about eliminating competition&mdash;I
know I&#39;m an idealist, but there really is still something to be said for
<em>content</em>.</p>

<h2>Shakin&#39; &amp; Quakin&#39;</h2>

<p>For the first time I can positively identify, I felt an earthquake this
morning&mdash;I suppose that&#39;s what I get for waking up early and 
studying.  There have been times before I&#39;ve thought I&#39;ve felt a
quake, only to realize that it&#39;s just a large truck driving by or the
laundry on a spin cycle.  In all the false-positive cases (and this real
one), I&#39;m sitting at my main computer.  The monitor&#39;s a hefty
19-inch CRT on a little stand built onto the desk.  It starts jiggling a 
little, and I think &ldquo;I wonder if that&#39;s an earthquake&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Well, this time it was.  The Pasadena office of the USGS is reporting <a
href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/ca/STORE/X14151344/ciim_display.html">a
magnitude 5.6 quake out in the inland empire</a>.  Seemed a little different
this time, too&mdash;it lasted <em>much</em> longer than I thought it would,
probably around ten seconds or so.  I got up to see if other parts of the
house were shaking, and, sure enough, some of our little knicknacks were
rattling around a bit.  Somewhat surprisingly, the cats didn&#39;t seem at
all frightened, or even surprised.  The quake didn&#39;t even wake Lindsey,
so she&#39;s not too scared, either.</p>

<p>In any case, an interesting new experience.  Speaking of which, there are
rumors (which I picked up from <a 
href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/12/130234">a Slashdot
article</a>) that Mac OS&nbsp;X for x86 has been leaked.  Ah, if only I had
the time and energy to start playing with that instead of studying.  (Okay,
to tell the truth, I just haven&#39;t been able to find it yet, and figured
I shouldn&#39;t waste any more time this morning.)  Let me know if you try
it out&mdash;as usual, I&#39;m curious.</p>

<h2>The Smiths</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356910/">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</a> 
may be the best movie I&#39;ve seen this year.  (For nostalgic purposes,
I&#39;m having a little trouble reconciling that possibility against my love
for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">The Hitchhiker&#39;s
Guide to the Galaxy</a>.)  An easy and enjoyable four stars;  see it if you
have the chance.  I&#39;m not much of an <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/">Angelina Jolie</a> fan, but I&#39;ve
liked just about everything <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/">Brad Pitt</a>&#39;s done, so I
was at least happy to give it a try&mdash;and it&#39;s an absolutely
hilarious action movie.  Lindsey even really liked it.  There are only 
three or four more movies I&#39;m really motivated to see this summer, so
I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good bet this one would be a good bet for you.</p>

<p>In unrelated news, the first person I know to have taken this summer&#39;s
USMLE finished it today.  My friend Kelechi left me with the impression he
wasn&#39;t overwhelmed by it, and finished in less than four hours.  That
bodes well for me&mdash;I don&#39;t work nearly as hard as Kelechi, but then
I don&#39;t expect to get nearly as good a score.  As I&#39;ve said before,
I&#39;m happy getting above the mean.  Still, keep wishing me 
luck&mdash;I&#39;ve got just over two weeks left to prepare.</p>

<h2>Open Source &ldquo;Community&rdquo;</h2>

<p>It seems like that &ldquo;community&rdquo; word has been coming up more
and more lately.  Yeah, I consider that a good thing (lower case), if only
because I generally consider &ldquo;community&rdquo; a Good Thing&reg;.  I
went to undergrad in what I would consider the closest thing to a real
community that I&#39;ve ever lived in, and I&#39;ve been desperately trying
to get back to it ever since&mdash;that sense not just of camaraderie, but
of people truly considering others in their actions, caring about others in
the community, and doing what they can to make <em>everyone&#39;s</em>
experience worthwhile&mdash;not just their own.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I read a <a 
href="http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/08/2017218">NewsForge 
editorial about the lack of community in open source</a>, or at least the
apparent lack, but doesn&#39;t go into any real depth.  Today there&#39;s a <a 
href="http://www.macobserver.com/columns/devilsadvocate/2005/20050610.shtml">Mac
Observer editorial chastising the community of &ldquo;Mac 
evangelists&rdquo;</a>, those who actually drive others away from wanting to 
buy a Mac because of their zealotry.  (No, the irony that I was apparently
wrong about &ldquo;how cool&rdquo; the Intel Mac was a couple of days ago is
not lost on me.)</p>

<p>Finally, though, is a topic that&#39;s been coming to a head for a while
now:  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.  The benevolent dictator
of the project has a fairly well-known temper.  Some say he has an attitude
problem, arrogance, and so forth&mdash;I&#39;m not one to judge him on that
aspect.  The general consensus among developers and long-time users is that
he&#39;s in charge, the developers develop for themselves, not for the users,
and the users offer intelligent feedback and questions;  if a user wants 
something that&#39;s not there, they can mention it, but they aren&#39;t
generally to get upset if developers say &ldquo;That&#39;s not a priority for
us&rdquo;.  I&#39;ve only been an OpenBSD user for about a year, so I don&#39;t
know if it&#39;s always been this way, but it seems to work for the 
project.</p>

<p>Lately, perhaps because OpenBSD has been getting more publicity, there seems
to be a greater number of questions on the mailing lists from people who 
clearly don&#39;t get this concept.  It&#39;s not exactly the type of 
community I was talking about before, but it is a group with a common goal
and a reasonable way of doing things, and it&#39;s been disrupted quite a bit
lately by people who may or may not be well-intentioned and who seem to care
less about OpenBSD and more about their own problems.  Not surprisingly, a
large number of people who have been around a while take issue with this, and
this all lead to a <a 
href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=111840825900002">misc@openbsd thread
about being nicer on the list</a>&mdash;which does absolutely nothing to quell
the actual problem.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not suggesting being dictatorial is a great way to get your
point across&mdash;only that those who disrupt a community can&#39;t expect
to be invited and welcomed graciously.</p>

<h2>Developer Transition Kit</h2>

<p>Just a quick update (during a rare break in my studies) to my comments
a couple of days ago about <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>&#39;s
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/transitionkit.html">Developer Transition
Kit</a>, the system designed for developers to start building Intel binaries:
it turns out that for $999 you get a <em>lease</em> of the hardware, not
keep it.  That&#39;s not yet been confirmed (I sent an email to Apple but 
haven&#39;t yet received a reply), but it at least makes a lot more sense.</p>

<p>That&#39;s actually a Good Thing&reg;, as I have neither the money nor the
time to pick one of these up and start screwing around with it&mdash;but 
probably would have done so, anyway.</p>

<h2>Back to studying</h2>

<p>After a nice long weekend off, it&#39;s back to the grindstone.  I&#39;ve
got just under three weeks until I take the USMLE Step 1;  at this point,
I&#39;m hoping for just over the mean.  (By this time next week, I may just
be hoping to pass.)  Yesterday and today have been concentrating on 
embryology;  I&#39;m almost finished with that, then it&#39;s on to several
days of pathology.</p>

<p>The only actual news I wanted to mention today was yesterday&#39;s
announcement of <a href="http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/11914">the demise of
DVD Decrypter</a>.  The first DVD ripper I ever used, DVD Decrypter has
always been easy to use, and set the bar by which I still measure capabilities
of software that lets me copy a movie from disc to hard drive (still the most
convenient way to watch a movie on the road with my laptop).  As it turns out,
I downloaded the last version ever to be released (3.5.4.0) a few weeks ago,
and had considered posting it here, but I don&#39;t have the fight left in me
today.  Yup, it&#39;s slackers like me who have apparently let the studios
win another one&hellip;.</p>

<h2>When did I become Steve Jobs&#39;s butt-boy?</h2>

<p>So I&#39;m taking a break from studying, and I see that <a 
href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has just announced that <a 
href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html">Macs will soon
be using Intel processors</a>.  What&#39;s more, a &ldquo;Developer
Transition Kit&rdquo; is now available to members of <a 
href="http://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a>;  it 
consists of a 3.6 GHz Pentium 4 running Mac OS X 10.4 for $999.  What&#39;s
particularly frightening is that <em>that excites the hell out of me</em>.
This is the same reaction I had to the <a 
href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a>.  <em>I want one.</em></p>

<p>Also somewhat disturbing is that depending on the quality of the machine
(which, honestly, can&#39;t be bad coming from Apple), and including the
$500 fee for joining ADC at a sufficient level to buy, tihs is actually a
good price.  The absolute cheapest I can get a <a 
href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> 3.6 GHz P4 is $1,099, without much 
software or hardware (comparable to what I&#39;m expecting).  Mind you, 
I&#39;m not a paying member of ADC, so it&#39;s quite uncertain what the specs
are on that machine, but it&#39;s clearly not the outrageous markup we&#39;ve
come to expect from Apple.</p>

<h2>New Server</h2>

<p>I spent the weekend migrating this site (along with all of <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/">aleph0.com</a>, <a 
href="http://www.christianjones.md/">christianjones.md</a>, and <a
href="http://www.norightsreserved.org/">norightsreserved.org</a>) to a new
server.  Well, &ldquo;different&rdquo; server would probably be a better
term, as I&#39;ve had the hardware for years.  It&#39;s an AMD Duron 1.3 GHz
with (only) 96 MB of RAM and a 40 GB hard disk.  This might seem a bit
underpowered for a server, but it&#39;s only a low-traffic http server; the
most popular stuff on it is my friend <a 
href="http://www.aleph0.com/~deb/">Deb</a>&#39;s med school notes and such.
Besides, the computer this site has been running on for years is Pentium MMX
233 MHz with only 64 MB of RAM;  this is definitely a step up, and I have,
somewhat surprisingly, been able to tell a difference in performance of the
server.</p>

<p>I also took the opportunity&mdash;in fact, the real reason for the 
upgrade&mdash;to upgrade to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>
3.7;  OpenBSD only makes patches for the last year&#39;s worth of systems, and
the old 3.5 machine was ready for bed.  Expect the same thing next year around
this time.</p>

<p>For now, though, it&#39;s back to studying, at least until I find out if I
passed the comprehensive exam&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Freer speech</h2>

<p>Well, more free, if only slightly so.  The <a
href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> (of which, by the way, I&#39;m now a proud
member) is reporting that <a
href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/003625.php">offering a 
copyrighted work is not the same as distributing it</a>;  those who wish to
sue someone for copyright infringement must actually prove that the work was,
for instance, downloaded illegally, rather than just being posted on the web
or listed in an index.  This means (I believe), that sites listing where to
go for copyrighted content or making indexes of <a
href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">BitTorrent</a> files is not infringement.
(Hosting a tracker, however, will remain up in the air for some time, of
course.)  This is a Good Thing&reg;</p>

<p>Keeping with the whole free speech thing, I&#39;m consistently amused that
one large group is as active as it is about speech and privacy:  librarians.
I still have the image of every librarian I&#39;ve ever known as a semi-retired
woman with graying hair who&#39;s very pleasant, but seems very conservative.
Whether this is an accurate picture or not, they tend to get anxious about
little things like the &ldquo;PATRIOT&rdquo; act&#39;s seizure of library
records;  the <a
href="http://www.ala.org/">American Library Association</a> even has an <a
href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/">Office for Intellectual Freedom</a>.  It
may be a bit easier in the near future to deal with such requests for
information from the government:  <a 
href="http://www.infotoday.com">Information Today</a> is reporing that <a
href="http://www.infotoday.com/cilmag/jun05/Ostrowsky.shtml">anonymous library
cards may be on their way</a>.  Yeah, I&#39;ve got to respect that.</p>

<p>So my exam went fine (probably), and I&#39;m more-or-less taking the weekend
off to recuperate;  I&#39;ll start studying for the boards again on Monday.
I&#39;m also doing a bit of behind-the-scenes work here on the web server, 
including adding support for <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>&#39;s
new <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/">Sitemaps</a> service,
and upgrading to a new machine running OpenBSD 3.7.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll
mention more about these changes over the next several weeks, so stay tuned.</p>

<h2>Deep Throat</h2>

<p>(No, not like that, you sick bastards!)  In what&#39;s sure to be the
most-read story of the day, <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8064563/">Bob Woodward describes meeting
Deep Throat</a> and their subsequent relationship (which sounds far more racy
from this brief description than is probably intended).  It&#39;s very
interesting to read about all this, but <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6210240/">Keith Olbermann</a> still
doesn&#39;t think they&#39;ve got the right guy, and he asks some good
questions.</p>

<p>Off that subject and on to some computing.  Good news, and bad.  First, the
<a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/003619.php">EFF has declared
victory on the broadcast flag issue</a>, or at least has come as close as
I&#39;d like them to.  Digital television, if it ever is actually mandated to
be the only television, is unlikely to require the broadcast flag at least at
the beginning.  No, my <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV</a> card is
no longer necessary (and, for that matter, still not set up properly), but
it&#39;s nice to have the support of a good manufacturer if it&#39;s needed
later on, anyway.</p>

<p>The bad news (from my perspective) is really only a warning&mdash;<a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8063259/">the threat of power outages this
summer</a> seems to be on the rise for the southeast and southwest US.  Oh,
Southern California seems to be used to them at this point, but my servers 
likely only last for a few minutes on their UPSs;  if &ldquo;rolling
blackouts&rdquo; take an hour or more, I&#39;m likely to see some downtime.
Sure, that doesn&#39;t hurt my bottom line as though I run some commercial
server space&mdash;but it still hurts my <em>pride</em>.</p>

<p>Okay, so back to studying.  I&#39;m currently only averaging about 60% on 
the <a href="http://kaplanmedical.com/">Kaplan</a> practice tests I&#39;m 
taking, but I&#39;m getting the impression they&#39;re <em>much</em> harder
than the comprehensive exam I&#39;ll be taking tomorrow, if not harder than
the USMLE itself.  I&#39;m just starting to be fairly confident I&#39;ll go
on to third year, but wish me luck anyway&mdash;I can always use a little 
more.</p>

<h2>Still studying&hellip;</h2>

<p>Not a lot of news today, but I took the evening off to watch a couple
old episodes of <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/DeadLikeMe/">Dead Like Me</a>
and relax with Lindsey.  It&#39;s a shame the show&#39;s been cancelled, but
at least that means I&#39;ll have the entire collection when the second
season is released on DVD in a few weeks.  I suppose it&#39;s not that
surprising, either&mdash;I&#39;ve noticed smart, funny, vaguely disturbing
series being cancelled on TV for years.  The first I remember was also one 
of the funniest sitcoms I can remember, <a 
href="http://www.tvtome.com/StarkRavingMad/">Stark Raving Mad</a>.  I&#39;m
sure, though, that such a thing was happenning long before I was born.</p>

<p>Studying&#39;s going surprisingly well, even as it&#39;s quite unpleasant.
I&#39;ve finished reading <span class="longtitle">First Aid for the USMLE 
Step 1</span> and moved on to <a 
href="http://www.princetonreview.com/">Princeton Review</a>&#39;s
<span class="longtitle">Cracking the Boards: USMLE Step 1</span>.  
I&#39;d love to have it done well before my comprehensive
exam on Friday, but I don&#39;t know how likely that is.  Still, I&#39;ve
read several hundred pages over the last few days, so hopefully I&#39;ll be
able to keep it up.</p>

<p>Oh, and if I can actually pull off a decent boards score and pass the 
comprehensive, I might just have to write a little guide about how best to
procrastinate and cram for the USMLE.</p>

<h2>Gaming (not gambling)</h2>

<p>I&#39;m not much of a gamer.  I&#39;ve got friends who spend their extra
hours playing World of Warcraft, Vice City: San Andreas, or whatever the 
current games are.  Personally, I&#39;m looking for another decent version
of Civilization (or <a href="http://www.freeciv.org/">Freeciv</a>) or another
turn-based strategy I can play reasonably well.  To be honest, I&#39;m just
looking for something a little interesting that not everyone kicks my ass at.
(I remember being great at Descent, and horrible at Doom, for instance.
Haven&#39;t played many 3D games ever since.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s this search for something a little different that made <span
class="shorttitle"><a
href="http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/games/manifesto.html">A 
Gamers&#39; Manifesto</a></span> such a nice (and funny) read.  Twenty points
unlikely to be addressed by the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, or Nintendo
Revolution&mdash;and right near the front, at number 2, is &ldquo;Give us
a genre of game we&#39;ve never seen before&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why isn&#39;t a there a spy game where <em>we actually get to be a real spy</em> rather than a hallway-roving kill machine? You know, where we actually have to talk to contacts and extract information and tap phones and piece together clues, a game full of exotic locales and deception and backstabbing and subplots? A game where a gun is used as often as a real spy would use it (that is, almost never)?</p>
<p>Where&#39;s the game where we&#39;re a castaway on a deserted island and the object of the game is to find food and clean water and build a shelter, a game where we can play for one month or six months, because whether or not we get rescued is randomized? Where every time we restart we get a different island with different wildlife and vegetation and water sources?</p>
<p>Where&#39;s the game where we play a salty Southern lawyer who has to piece together evidence to exonerate a black man falsely accused of murder, breaking down witnesses and spotting inconsistencies in testimony?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what universe are these games that wouldn&#39;t sell, games that
can&#39;t even get made?  One of the author&#39;s other suggestions is a game
were we actually play as Dr. Greg House &ldquo;diagnose mysterious illnesses
while crushing the patient&#39;s spirit with cruel insults&rdquo;.  Honestly,
if there was such a game announced for one of the new consoles (and it
didn&#39;t appear to suck as ridiculously as those &ldquo;Emergency Room&rdquo;
games), I&#39;d preorder the console today.</p>

<p>Of course, it&#39;s not going to happen.  Looks like I&#39;ll stick with
searching <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a> for open source
games.</p>

<h2>Blogging journalism</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned before some of the issues I have with treating bloggers
and journalists differently.  I&#39;m in no way claiming to be a journalist;
I&#39;m more of an editor.  I don&#39;t do any real investigating, I usually
just gather information and pass it on, often with editorial comments.
I&#39;m not claiming to be a journalist, but I see no reason to be treated
differently from a legal standpoint.  Speech is speech.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m mentioning this is because of the apparent state of 
those who society does consider journalists.  <a 
href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> linked to an article today
entitled <span class="shorttitle"><a 
href="http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=4069">Microsoft-Netscape
Conflict Leaves Firefox</a></span>.  I read tech articles quite frequently,
but this one caught my eye for a different reason:  even the short blurb
in the Google News summary sounded ridiculous:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the average user, Microsoft&#39;s recommendations to either uninstall 
the Netscape browser or fix a specific code in the registry makes no sense.</p>
<p>Most computer users have no idea how to install or even uninstall software.
Trying to fix something foreign such as the registry is like reading Greek in 
Latin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignoring the one- and two-sentence &ldquo;paragraphs&rdquo;, let&#39;s 
look at the
only real &ldquo;fact&rdquo; reported here first:  &ldquo;Most computer users
have no idea how to install or even uninstall software&rdquo;.  First, the
topic is about <em>uninstalling</em>, and that&#39;s generally considered 
slightly more difficult than installing software, so let&#39;s at least switch
which verb is next to the &ldquo;even&rdquo;.  Next, let&#39;s make a simple
note:  if a user is confronted with the numerous conflicts between Netscape 
and Internet Explorer, then they have by definition <em>already installed</em>
Netscape&mdash;this latest version with all the reported problems wasn&#39;t 
present on their computers when they bought them.  Oh, and let&#39;s not forget
the suggestion that the registry is &ldquo;like reading Greek in Latin&rdquo;.
I&#39;m no fan of the registry, and I wouldn&#39;t want to explain editing it
to much of anyone, but &ldquo;like reading Greek in Latin&rdquo;?  I don&#39;t
even know what that means.</p>

<p>Mind you, these are just the first three <em>sentences</em>.  Steve
Sabludowsky, the &ldquo;reporter&rdquo; who submitted this piece goes on later
to such hard-hitting writing as &ldquo;That is a big WOW and it doesn&#39;t 
take a degree in foreign archaic languages to understand the 
significance&rdquo;.  This guy (I think) would commonly be considered a 
&ldquo;journalist&rdquo; (if only because his story&#39;s linked to on Google
News), while I&#39;m not.  Whether the site this story is on (<a
href="http://www.bayoubuzz.com/">BayouBuzz.com</a>) is a blog or not, Mr.
Sabludowsky&#39;s also apparently active in local media, including the New
Orleans Times Picayune Newspaper, the Greater Baton Rouge Business Report, and
so forth.  (His &ldquo;About this Author&rdquo; actually starts with the line:
&ldquo;Attorney, Writer, teacher, and Publisher of Bayoubuzz.com Mr. Stephen
Sabludowsky is an attorney, writer and teacher.&rdquo;  If I had any indication
this sentence was intended to be funny, it would be.  Instead, it&#39;s just
sad.)</p>

<p>So Mr. Sabludowsky is probably considered by the world at large to be a
journalist, while judges are more interested in making sure I don&#39;t have
the rights to protect my sources (or wouldn&#39;t have the rights, if I had
any sources).  I&#39;m not complaining about Mr. Sabludowsky&#39;s success in
the face of what is surely great adversity, nor about society&#39;s view of
his being in some way superior to me.  (Well, okay, I suppose I may be
complaining a bit about the latter.)  My real complaint is that if we make
some distinction between journalism and whatever the alternative is, it would
be nice for that to be based, at least marginally, on <em>writing</em>.</p>

<h2>Why smart people defend bad ideas</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, an excellent
article (or even &ldquo;essay&rdquo;) was brought to my attention.  I
haven&#39;t finished it yet, but it&#39;s really impressive so far.
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay40.htm">Why smart
people defend bad ideas</a>&rdquo; by <a 
href="http://www.scottberkun.com/">Scott Berkun</a> is not only an
insightful look at how to keep from defending your choices to others when
the ideas are wrong, but also how to defend yourself against those people
who are doing so.  More importantly to me, however, it&#39;s about not
trying to win stupid arguments with <em>yourself</em>, like whether to 
study or edit a show you&#39;ve downloaded from the TiVo.  A brief excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From what we know of evolution it&#39;s clear that we are alive because of our inherited ability to think quickly and respond to change. The survival of living creatures, for most of the history of our planet, has been a short term game. Only if you can out-run your predators, and catch your prey, do you have the luxury of worrying about tomorrow.</p>
<p>It follows then that we tend to be better at worrying about and solving short term issues than long term issues. Even when we recognize an important long term issue that we need to plan for, say protecting natural resources or saving for retirement, we&#39;re all too easily distracted away from those deep thoughts by immediate things like dinner or sex (important things no doubt, but the driving needs in these pursuits, at least for this half of the species, are short term in nature). Once distracted, we rarely return to the long term issues we were drawn away from.</p>

<h2>Lindsey&#39;s Birthday</h2>

<p>Studied some this morning, but I&#39;m trying to make as much of today
as possible about Lindsey.  After she got up, we went out to see <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/">Madagascar</a> (which was pretty
poor&mdash;2 stars), have a decent lunch at <a 
href="http://www.chilis.com/">Chili&#39;s</a>, and then got her an ice cream
cake at <a href="http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/">Cold Stone</a>.  She
openned a couple of presents (just some games I got her), and then we took
a nap.  Pretty lame, if you think so, but damn if it&#39;s not a good day for
us.  Still, I&#39;m <em>really</em> tired (we just got up a few minutes ago).
She&#39;s on the phone with her sister now, so hopefully some cake will wake
me in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Probably little more studying to do today&mdash;I really hope I&#39;m not
falling behind too much, but I swear I&#39;m going to have to start studying
hard Real Soon Now&reg;.</p>

<h2>Excellent doctors</h2>

<p>There&#39;s something to be said for being personable.  My doctor, Todd
Forman, is undoubtedly one of the most excellent physicians I&#39;ve ever
met.  He&#39;s intelligent, reassuring, and friendly.  He has one outstanding
skill, though, that I still can&#39;t put my finger on, one that&#39;s shared
by only a handful of other people I&#39;ve met in my life.  Without 
condescending, even requesting, he makes you want to do better.</p>

<p>My undergraduate advisor had the same skill;  I remember missing a day of
class in the second semester of my first year or the first semester of my
second at <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd</a>.  <a
href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/">Ran Libeskind-Hadas</a> was the 
instructor, and he was outstanding, so it was unusual to miss his class.  
Still, I was tired, so I stayed in.  Less than an hour after class was over,
Ran sent me an email &ldquo;wanting to make sure everything was okay&rdquo;,
and made me feel like going to class every day thereafter whether I was tired
or not, without even hinting I&#39;d done anything wrong.</p>

<p>Todd&#39;s the same way.  Nope, don&#39;t worry about starting any new
medication until you&#39;re finished with boards.  Sure, exercise, eat better,
but don&#39;t stress out about it.  And you know what?  It actually makes me
<em>want</em> to exercise and eat better, and I&#39;ll be more than happy to
see him to start on an ACE inhibitor shortly after finishing the USMLE in a
month.  Wow.</p>

<p>Oh, and completely off-topic (as if I consider that a problem here):  <a

<h2>USMLE makes my BP rise</h2>

<p>Alright, I have no reason to think that it&#39;s a causal relationship,
but as I approach the USMLE Step 1 (not to mention my Year II Comprehensive
next week), my blood pressure keeps climbing.  I&#39;m already taking a
regular dose of hydrochlorothyazide;  an earlier trial of a beta blocker
(atenolol) is what I consider my primary reason for failing the GI system
originally, so I&#39;m desperately trying not to start any new meds.  Oh,
it could be stress, it could be anxiety, it could be anger, it could be
(gasp) my obesity&mdash;but none of these are likely to be resolved any time
soon, despite my best efforts.  At the moment, my focus has to be on the
next month&#39;s worth of hardcore studying;  I&#39;m just trying to make sure
that it doesn&#39;t compromise the next several years of living which I hope
to come after the exams.</p>

<p>In any case, I&#39;ve got the first appointment with my doctor today in a
few months, so we&#39;ll see what he has to say (other than &ldquo;lose weight
and here are some more beta blockers&rdquo;, of course).</p>

<h2>Sitting in the airport</h2>

<p>Thanks to the Orlando International Airport&#39;s complementary
(or otherwise unsecured) wireless access, I&#39;ve got my first taste
of high-speed Internet access in five days.  Phew.  So much better.</p>

<p>We&#39;re about a half hour from boarding our flight to Atlanta (where
we&#39;ll connect to LA).  Sitting, surfing, and being incredibly tired,
Lindsey pointed out a nice new quote to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs. Schroedinger to Mr. Schroedinger:  What the hell did
you do to the cat?  It looks half dead!</p></blockquote>

<p>People are only just starting to get on my nerves again&mdash;I wonder
if it&#39;s because Orlando tends to have more people who aren&#39;t from
Florida, or if it&#39;s because people are just never happy in airports.
Either way, I&#39;m really just wishing they&#39;d sit down and shut up.
Okay, so it&#39;s not like that&#39;s a particularly new (or helpful)
idea of mine, but that doesn&#39;t stop it from occurring.  The only 
benefit I see at this point is that it&#39;s not quite summer, hence
there aren&#39;t yet a ton of families here visiting The Rat.</p>

<p>Time to log off.  I&#39;ll be back on the west coast before 2100, and
hopefully home shortly thereafter.  Doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll get
to watch the season finale of <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/Lost/">Lost</a>
tonight, but that&#39;s what the TiVo&#39;s for, right?  Dear god, don&#39;t
even <em>think</em> about telling me what happens before tomorrow 
evening....</p>

<h2>Encrypters are child pornographers</h2>

<p>According to CNET news, <a 
href="http://news.com.com/Minnesota+court+takes+dim+view+of+encryption/2100-1030_3-5718978.html">a
Minnesota court has ruled that the presence of encryption software is evidence</a>, much to the uproar
of some online groups.  In an appeal decision, a judge upheld a ruling that said the presence of
<a href="http://www.pgp.com/">PGP</a> on the defendant&#39;s computer can be used against him.
(I assume, then, that so can open-source solutions, like <a href="http://www.gnupgpg.org/">GnuPG</a>.)
The disagreement among privacy advocates, I assume, is based mostly on the &ldquo;but I use 
encryption, and I&#39;m not a criminal&rdquo; argument.</p>

<p>Hey, so do I.  I use Mac OS X&#39;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/filevault/">FileVault</a>,
which is specifically mentioned in the article as only possibly related;  I use SSH and SSL for a 
decent amount of internet traffic.  I&#39;ve meant to set up GnuPG a number of times, and have
never gotten around to it.  Does that make me a criminal?  Not yet, at least.</p>

<p>So why am I not outraged?  Because we&#39;re not talking about probable cause or even
anything vaguely related.  We&#39;re talking about evidentiary rules, the claim that the presence
of the software is relevant&mdash;and it is.  The defendant wasn&#39;t found to have much incriminating
evidence on his computer, but was found to have several encrypted files. There&#39;s most certainly a
reasonable doubt that those files were porn;  I know plenty of people who encrypt their bank statements.
But that&#39;s not what he was convicted of&mdash;his conviction was based mostly upon the words of
the nine-year-old girl he made pose for him.</p>

<p>The guy uses encryption.  Hey, that&#39;s what it&#39;s there for.  Is it relevant that he uses
it?  Of course.  It&#39;s exactly the reason why police didn&#39;t find more evidence;  the evidence
was encrypted.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s relevant for the jury to hear.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the only problem I have:  it may be considered inflammatory.  &ldquo;Why does a fine, 
upstanding citizen need encryption?  He must be guilty.&rdquo;  This same logic isn&#39;t applied
to locks on our doors, safes in our homes, or even guns in our nightstands&mdash;computer
technology not used by the masses scares people a little.  This is where <em>education</em> is
probably a good idea.  Get people to use encryption, to understand the value, or just say your
client is worried about identity theft.  But don&#39;t say it&#39;s not relevant.</p>

<h2>Leaving Gainesville</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Vacation&rdquo; is almost over;  we&#39;re leaving Gainesville for the airport
(in Orlando) in a couple of hours.  Lindsey&#39;s up at the Math department right now,
catching up with friends and staff members.  I stopped by yesterday, and even got to
run into my old advisor, <a href="http://www.math.ufl.edu/~bona/">Miklos Bona</a>.
In general, all happy wishes all around.</p>

<p>Oh, I miss a lot about Gainesville, most especially the way receptionists, 
servers, and generally everyone you deal with on a daily basis actually has some
kind words and a smile.  This basic community aura is something you just don&#39;t 
find in Los Angeles, and reiterates my desire to eventually &ldquo;settle
down&rdquo; in a nice little college town somewhere.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I can&#39;t recall at the moment how much worse it will get
when the students are back in town&mdash;only a small fraction is enrolled for the summer
session.  Also, it&#39;s really freaking hot (though I doubt that has as much to do
with the university as with the sun).</p>

<p>On a final note, I passed GI (finally), so it really will be all about working my
butt off for the next month or so.  First the second-year comprehensive exam on 
3 June (only a week and two days from now), and then the USMLE step 1 on 27 June (a
month and two days from now).  Nah, no pressure at all.</p>

<h2>Gainesville</h2>

<p>Well, after a couple of days of rest, I&#39;m finally once again
self-aware enough to begin blogging.  Gainesville&#39;s almost exactly
as I remember it, which is at once disturbing and comforting, considering
it&#39;s been right at about two years since I left.  All the great
(from my point of view) restaurants are still in place, all the buildings
are where I remember them, and the only real changes are even more new
and developing apartment complexes.</p>

<p>I should also say that my fear didn&#39;t pan out&mdash;people
aren&#39;t the same everywhere.  Oh, there <em>are</em> people who are
the same everywhere, but populations do in fact differ&mdash;I&#39;m 
much happier with the more-regularly smiling faces, the &ldquo;Southern
hospitality&rdquo;, and so forth in Gainesville.  Certainly, though, that
may have something to do with the fact that the spring semester at <a
href="http://www.ufl.edu/">UF</a> is over and most of the students are out
of town.</p>

<p>We&#39;re off to St. Augustine this afternoon to hear some guy play
in some bar there.  I&#39;ve been trying to get some studying done, so
I&#39;ll keep reading my <a href="http://www.review.com/">Princeton
Review</a> USMLE book until then.  After the first day of exhaustion (we
flew out on the red-eye Friday night), that&#39;s pretty much all I did
yesterday.  Meh.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Vacation&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Yeah, the quotes are supposed to be there.  Lindsey and I are leaving 
for a 5-day trip to Florida tonight;  one of her friends is getting married
in Gainesville.  It should be a nice trip, except that I&#39;m behind on
my studying and so will be taking a couple of books along with me.  Still,
(and sadly the highlight of the trip for me) we&#39;ll have a chance to go
back to all our favorite restaurants, including <a
href="http://www.carrabbas.com/">Carrabba&#39;s</a>, <a
href="http://www.sonnysbbq.com/">Sonny&#39;s</a>, and 
last-but-certainly-not-least Five Star Pizza.  Lord only knows what other 
places we&#39;ll fit into our schedule, but that should be a nice change of
pace.  (Nothing like getting &ldquo;back to the status quo&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to try to blog a bit while we&#39;re there, as well as a
little more leading up to and into third year.  I took my GI make-up exam
about a week and a half ago, but it could still be some time until I get
the results.  Should be sometime before June 3, when I&#39;m scheduled to
take the Year II comprehensive.  That&#39;s two weeks from now (today&#39;s
when the non-failures had to take that exam), and hopefully I&#39;ll be
well-prepared for the comp, and well on my way to being prepared for the
boards, by then.  I&#39;m taking the USMLE step 1 on June 27, so there&#39;s
still plenty of work to be done.</p>

<p>For now, though, packing&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Computing</h2>

<p>So I think I know why I spend so much of my &ldquo;free&rdquo; time
doing computer stuff, programming, building machines and setting up 
software on them, installing strange things to play with and uninstalling
them fifteen minutes later.  I use a lot of time doing it that I should be
using for studying, getting other work done, and the like.  Unsurprisingly,
I think a large portion, if not all of it, is due to one thing:  control.</p>

<p>Sure, it may be fairly typical among <a
href="http://www.typelogic.com/entj.html">ENTJ</a>s to enjoy control (not to
mention typical among computer geeks), but I think it&#39;s a little more
than that.  It&#39;s displaced control, as in &ldquo;I&#39;m nervous about
this exam, and I should study&mdash;or I could install the latest CVS of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and see if it works on this
old laptop.&rdquo;  It&#39;s what I feel like doing when I have runs-in with
the neighbors, or am annoyed at the crappy way everyone in LA seems to drive.
It&#39;s not that I like controlling computers, it&#39;s that I like having
<em>some</em> major part of my life that I <em>can</em> control.</p>

<p>Which, I suppose, is why I start to get inordinately frustrating when
the computers aren&#39;t working right.  Especially if I can&#39;t figure
out why.  One of the first things that drew me toward programming and basic
hacking was the first &ldquo;meta-rule&rdquo; I remember: <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/G/GIGO.html">GIGO</a>, Garbage
In, Garbage Out.  Something doesn&#39;t work?  It&#39;s because I did
something wrong&mdash;figure out what and exert more control over your
domain.  Spend time on it, don&#39;t, whatever, but don&#39;t 
complain&mdash;it was <em>my</em> garbage in that caused the problem.</p>

<p>Except, it seems, more and more often that&#39;t not particularly true.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m consistently (and somewhat unsuccessfully) trying to
get away from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Microsoft
Windows</a>, and why I get particularly frustrated when things don&#39;t
work like they&#39;re supposed to, or like documentation (if it exists) says
they will.</p>

<p>So, any advice for better hobbies to use as surrogate control mechanisms?
Nah, I got nothin&#39; either.  (I&#39;ve tried games, but am really only
interested in the kind that you play with other people&mdash;and
<em>there&#39;s</em> a real headache when it comes to lack of control.)</p>

<h2>Tiger</h2>

<p>I haven&#39;t installed it yet, but I picked up <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS&nbsp;X</a> 10.4
(&ldquo;Tiger&rdquo;) today from the <a
href="http://www.uscbookstore.com/">USC Bookstore</a> computer store.
As it turns out, it&#39;s just slightly over half-price ($69) with an
academic discount, and I can justify that much for &ldquo;fun&rdquo;.
As I said, I haven&#39;t installed it yet (not a lot of free time), 
but plan to soon, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have some observations
then.  For the moment, I&#39;ll only mention that I&#39;m a bit surprised
it doesn&#39;t come with <a 
href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a>, which was included with my

<h2>Hitchhiking</h2>

<p>I was just <em>hoping</em> it was going to be reasonably good, and
desperately trying not to expect too much.  As it happens, <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to
the Galaxy</a> was very well done, indeed.  Lots of excellent English
humour, plenty of decent Douglas Adams in-jokes, and enough new 
material to justify laughing with the film and its characters.  The
only reason I&#39;m only giving it three stars is that I probably
won&#39;t see it again&mdash;I&#39;ll just read the books (which are
still more entertaining).  Still, very much worth a look.</p>

<h2>Enemies beware&hellip;</h2>

<p>(Frighteningly enough, I almost wrote &ldquo;enemas beware&rdquo;
entirely by accident.)</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, I saw that <a
href="http://www.time.com/">Time</a> is reporting that the <a
href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1053595,00.html">Bush
Administration is keeping Kerry supporters out of negotiations</a>.
Specifically, a few delegates to the Inter-American Telecommunication
Commission, which sets spectrum regulations and the like, have literally
been kicked <em>entirely</em> because they supported the Dems in 2004.</p>

<p>The White House&#39;s take?  Yep.  They &ldquo;wanted people who would
represent the Administration positively&rdquo;.  They&#39;re not denying
the facts in any way.  The Bush administration, in fact, says that you
don&#39;t take part if you didn&#39;t support them.</p>

<p>There is an argument here.  They won, so why should they cater to those
they beat?  Because that&#39;s what you do.  When you&#39;re governing the
entire country, you don&#39;t prevent those who didn&#39;t support you from
participating.  Sure, 55% voted for you&mdash;that&#39;s not a reason to
piss off the remaining 45%.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason to think that these reps wouldn&#39;t have
represented the administration positively.  There&#39;s no evidence they&#39;ve
ever done otherwise, except by participating in the democratic process.
I would expect that these people, were they to decide not to &ldquo;represent
the administration positively&rdquo;, wouldn&#39;t participate in such an
event in the first place.  The way to bring down a politician has very little
to do with &ldquo;Oh, sure, I think we can open up the 5GHz range.  By the
way, can you believe we voted for this guy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here I thought the worst problems were going to be the &ldquo;Town
Hall&rdquo; meetings&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Hard at work, but gotta see Tiger&hellip;</h2>

<p>I&#39;m nine weeks away from taking the USMLE step 1, and I&#39;ve
got three other exams in the meantime, so I&#39;m working pretty hard (for
a change).  Still, I took the time out to pre-order <a 
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">Mac OS X</a> 10.4
&ldquo;Tiger&rdquo; from the USC bookstore&mdash;with a student discount,
it drops from $130 to $70.  Sure, I don&#39;t generally buy software, but
I&#39;m giving <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> a chance.  It
really looks like I&#39;m shelling out almost entirely for eye candy, but
<em>wow</em>, what eye candy!</p>

<p>A few stores, apparently accidentally shipped the OS early, and I&#39;m
<em>really</em> impressed by one thing I didn&#39;t know was in there and
wouldn&#39;t have been all that impressed by, anyway:  an RSS screen saver.
That all changed, however, once I saw the <a 
href="http://media.weblogsinc.com/common/videos/engadget/TigerRSS.mov">RSS
Screen Saver Video</a>.  <em>Very</em> cool&mdash;maybe I&#39;ll start
using RSS after all&hellip;.</p>

<h2>GI Failure</h2>

<p>No, my health hasn&#39;t had a severe turn for the worse, but it&#39;s
official:  I failed the GI system.  I&#39;m not one for excuses&mdash;the
reason I failed was that I didn&#39;t work hard enough leading up to it.
Tons of dumb mistakes that I don&#39;t otherwise make, like choosing answers
I&#39;d never heard of, second-guessing myself, and so forth, may be 
attributed to having been on beta-blockers for a week, or may not, so I
won&#39;t bother with the excuse.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take a makeup exam, pass, and move on with medical school with a
nice fail to explain to residency committees.  That&#39;s fine&mdash;what
I&#39;m worried about now, though, is below.  Bolding is mine;  some lines
(phone numbers, emails, and such) have been removed or ammended to protect the
innocent:</p>

<blockquote class="email">

<p>From: David Hoffman</p>
<p>Subject: GI/Liver makeup exam</p>
<p>Dear Student:</p>
<p>You are required to take the GI/Liver makeup examination.  The exam will be 
administered on Monday, May 2nd from 1:00 - 5:00 in McKibben 256.</p>
<p><strong>The makeup exam will be in essay format.</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the exam content, you should contact 
either Dr. Sinatra or Dr. Stolz.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll see you on May 2nd at 1:00pm in MCH 256.</p>

<p>Assistant Director</p>
<p>Office for Curriculum</p>
<p>Keck School of Medicine</p>
<p>University of Southern California</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Essay format.  Wow.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I can write, and charm and
bullshit could work almost as well on an essay as in person, but how do I
<em>prepare</em> for an essay exam?  I honestly have no clue.  It will,
however, be interesting to see how much I&#39;m graded off for 
penmanship&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Agoraphobia</h2>

<p>I&#39;m really hoping that I&#39;m not developing some form of agoraphobia.
It seems that every time I go somewhere, I get annoyed and frustrated at people,
both in specific and in general.  Ended up not going to the movies and to a
&ldquo;new owner seminar&rdquo; for the car Lindsey bought in December basically
because I was a little down and in a very bad mood.  Sure, I feel like I have
a right to get pissed at people, but that&#39;s kind of the problem, isn&#39;t
it?</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m actually more concerned at the fact that it&#39;s not
completely alleviated when I&#39;m at home.  I&#39;m still getting angry at
the neighbors, at pizza delivery people, at pretty much anyone I have any 
contact with other than Lindsey and my few friends.  I write it up to the idea
that my anger stems from my disappointment with mankind, my frustration that
these people are looking out for themselves and not for others, but maybe
it&#39;s just anger.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so difficult for people just to
leave one another alone, and in those cases where there&#39;s (valuable)
interaction, why people tend to not care whether they keep their promises.
Yeah, I&#39;m pretty na&iuml;ve that way, I know.</p>

<h2>No need for freedom of the press, move along&hellip;</h2>

<p>The AP is reporting that <a
href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2005/03/11/financial/f122955S64.DTL">journalists
have no right to protect sources who obtained information illegally</a>.
This is a case of a few web news sites (some call them blogs, but in this
case that&#39;s not within my definition) who published information that
<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> and the judge in the case consider
trade secrets.  They&#39;re probably even right about that moniker.  Seems some
Apple employes gave the info to the sites, Apple chose to sue the employees,
and subpoenaed the names of the sites&#39; sources.  As journalists are wont
to do, the sites declined.</p>

<p>The judge has apparently chosen (somewhat thankfully) to decline deciding
whether the site writers count as journalists.  My argument would be that it
really doesn&#39;t matter, but as that point&#39;s moot, I won&#39;t make it
right now.  Instead, the judge suggests that the sites did something wrong
by <em>publishing</em> the trade secrets.</p>

<p>Okay, here&#39;s the problem I have:  yeah, I think the employees did
something wrong:  they violated the nondisclosure agreements they have.  
Actually, I should say that they thus broke their contracts, and should be
found to have done so in a civil court, not that they have actually done 
anything wrong, and certainly not that they have done anything 
<em>criminal</em>.  But they did it, and while I may have made the same choice,
I would expect to be held accountable for it.  But the sites?  They were given
information, verified it with numerous sources, and published it.  It&#39;s
<em>true</em>, it&#39;s not slander, and all they did was write it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware that most people follow &ldquo;Information wants to be
free&rdquo; with a &ldquo;well,&hellip;&rdquo;.  This case, however, is about
whether or not you&#39;re allowed to pass on information that someone gives you
<em>outside</em> of contractual obligation&mdash;the idea of this now being a
trade secret <em>which can&#39;t be mentioned</em> is making the distribution
of information <em>criminal</em>.  And for those Republicans who may be reading
(I know, who am I kidding?), we&#39;re not talking national defense here.</p>

<h2>All that work for nothin&#39;&hellip;</h2>

<p>Well, maybe.  I may have just failed my GI/Liver exam;  I won&#39;t know for
sure for a couple of weeks.  It&#39;s been a pretty crappy afternoon, and will
probably be a pretty crappy &ldquo;spring break&rdquo; for the next week.  
(Yes, I&#39;m aware it&#39;s not yet Spring, but the school is getting better
about it&mdash;our &ldquo;spring break&rdquo; last year was the last week of
February.)</p>

<p>At its best, this should motivate me to start working my ass off for the
boards (USMLE Step 1 for anyone keeping track).  I was hoping to have a nice
relaxing break, but that doesn&#39;t look too likely now.  I&#39;ll still get
a decent amount of computer stuff done, if only because it&#39;s the only real
chance I&#39;ll have for a while.  Believe it or not, I picked up three 
olde-tyme VAXservers at a police auction, so we&#39;ll see if those work and
I&#39;ll write a bit more about them when I pick them up.  I&#39;ve also got to
reformat and reinstall everything on my Windows computer, as it&#39;s really
starting to act up again.  Finally, I&#39;m planning to replace this server
with OpenBSD 3.6 (it&#39;s running 3.5 at the moment) on a higher-end machine
(I haven&#39;t decided which one yet), but that should be fairly seamless to
any of you loyal readers (as though you&#39;d even notice if it were down for
days).</p>

<p>Oh, and I got a free laptop.  Decent one, too.  More at some point in the 
near future.</p>

<h2>Time to get to work&hellip;</h2>

<p>This past Sunday marked four months until I&#39;m scheduled to take the <a
href="http://www.usmle.org/step1/">USMLE Step 1</a> exam, so it also marks one
of the many times I told myself I had to start working hard again.  So far, not
bad, not great.  I resigned as director of Chorda Tympani, the med school
a cappella group which wasn&#39;t progressing particularly well this year,
anyway.  Some of the time I used to put into that will certainly be spent 
studying, but I was also just appointed to the school&#39;s admissions
committee, so that will offset some of the gains as well.</p>

<p>Overall, most new studying time will come from where it probably should:
television watching, game playing, and computer tinkering.  Oh, I&#39;ll still
be doing more than my share of each, but will feel more guilty about it.  (In
fact, I&#39;ve already had to reduce all of them quite a bit&mdash;it&#39;s a
good thing February sweeps are over.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the extra study time also
means I&#39;ll have to pass up some nice opportunities, like the <a
href="http://www.calphys.org/html/bb798.asp">California Medical 
Association&#39;s Legislative Leadership Day</a> in Sacramento next month.
I&#39;d like to do it, but since it falls near the end of our final system of
the year, I&#39;d better be here instead.</p>

<h2>Gmail adds basic HTML support</h2>

<p>Ah, how glorious are standards!  I&#39;ve raved previously about <a
href="http://gmail.google.com">Gmail</a>, and you&#39;ve certainly read plenty
about it.  Before recently, however, I wasn&#39;t able to do quick checks from
a terminal window or &ldquo;unsupported browser&rdquo;.  This wasn&#39;t a huge
complaint, as Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, and Safari are
all supported.  Now, though, I can even check, send, and delete email from
within <a href="http://lynx.isc.org">Lynx</a>&mdash;excellent if only because
it&#39;s the only browser in a standard install of <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> or just about any other UNIX-like
system.  Gmail now has a basic HTML page, requiring only HTML and cookies to
work.  Who knows how useful it will be?  Who cares?  It&#39;s just a new little
nicety.</p>

<p>What do you mean, you can&#39;t try it out?  Don&#39;t you trust me?  Oh, I
see, you just need a Gmail account.  Feel free to <a 
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">drop me an email</a> just to ask for one.
Sure, I&#39;ll probably make some pathetic attempt at small talk, but you

<h2>Outrageously Expensive Speech</h2>

<p>As part of the &ldquo;free speech doesn&#39;t even have to come close&rdquo;
series, there&#39;s a great (and short) writeup at <a
href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/7047694">RollingStone.com on
FCC fines</a>.  Mid-February, the House passed the <a
href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c109:3:./temp/~c109pIGrqi::">&ldquo;Broadcast
Decency Enforcement Act</a>, which increases penalies for violations of 
deency laws by television and radio broadcasters.  The idea is that a single
violation (for instance, airing a tape of the word &ldquo;fuck&rdquo;) could
cost a station half a million dollars.  Much more interesting, though, is 
Rolling Stone&#39;s comparison to other federal fines:  turns out airing that
tape carries exactly the same fine as testing pesticides on human subjects.
But that&#39;s not all:</p>
<blockquote><p>And for the price of Janet Jackson's &ldquo;wardrobe 
malfunction&rdquo; during the Super Bowl, you could cause the wrongful death of 
an elderly patient in a nursing home and still have enough money left to create
dangerous mishaps at two nuclear reactors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, I&#39;m not really a blow-things-out-of-proportion type (okay, I am,
but for the sake of editorialism, let&#39;s say I&#39;m not);  these are the
<em>maximum</em> fines the House resolution may impose.  Several things will
be taken into consideration upon a violation, including size of the audience,
whether the program was scripted or improv, live or tape, and so 
forth&mdash;but also the violator&#39;s ability to pay.  This is where I get
really confused&mdash;something&#39;s less decent for a successful company than
for a skel on public access?  I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s important to have
putative damages to keep our innocent children from being exposed to such filth
in the first place, but is a real standard punishment so difficult to find that
the same act carries two different weights?  Ahh, the old syllogism about
arbitrary government comes to mind&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Movie Reviews</h2>

<p>Thanks to a long weekend that coincided with a <a 
href="http://www.starz.com/">Starz!</a> free preview on <a
href="http://www.directv.com">DirecTV</a>, Lindsey and I had the opportunity
to catch a few flicks this weekend:</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/">Constantine</a></dt>
<dd>Surprisingly good.  <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/">Keanu Reeves</a> is no worse than
usual, and is actually building quite an image for himself as the super-strong
98-pound weakling.  This is certainly one of the more entertaining and original
comic-based movies I&#39;ve seen in a while;  watch if you&#39;re in the mood
for some typical <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/">Vertigo</a> humor
and action.  Three stars.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/">Trainspotting</a></dt>
<dd>One of the &ldquo;new classics&rdquo; for the drugged masses that are we.
Not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/">Ewan McGregor</a>&#39;s
first film, but certainly his first memorable one.  I won&#39;t comment on how
realistic the movie is, but it is quite entertaining, and even a little
thought-provoking, but not for those with a weak stomach.  Original, worth a
watch, but probably not worth a second.  Three stars.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101889/">The Fisher King</a></dt>
<dd>Touted as a decent look at mental illness and the homeless, this film
doesn&#39;t quite live up to my expectations.  Both <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/">Robin Williams</a> and <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313/">Jeff Bridges</a> perform well, but
I&#39;m left &ldquo;too satisfied&rdquo; by the story, certainly not something
expected from any story about mental illness or the homeless.  Still, an
entertaining film that&#39;s worth seeing once.  Three stars.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Still have several movies (some of them likely to be crap) sitting on the
<a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a> to watch.  More later.</p>

<h2>Rain and blackouts</h2>

<p>It&#39;s been raining in Los Angeles for the past few days, and looks to
continue.  There&#39;s flooding, there are mudslides, and now, there are
blackouts.  Even though I live on a hill, I think it surprises no one that
the latter are of the most concern for me.  We lost power about five this 
morning for several seconds.  (I was awakened by the beeping of one of my UPSs.)
This afternoon, it was out for around half an hour or so&mdash;just enough to
again make me realize how ridiculously dependent I am upon the grid.</p>

<p>Oh, I&#39;ve had thoughts of going off-grid, but it continues to be
infeasible, mostly because of lack of cheap options for large (relative to
other residences) power consumption and a conspicuous lack of funds on my
part.  There was even an article in the Harvey Mudd College Bulleting alumni
rag about a alumnus who had done just that, living in some of the California
farm country and utilizing mostly solar power, but if I recall correctly he
didn&#39;t own a television and his &ldquo;information infrastructure&rdquo;
was composed of a single laptop.</p>

<p>So, for the moment, I&#39;ll rely upon inexpensive battery backups for my
primary machines and server, and apologize in advance for any downtime.  Still,
it&#39;s better than handing control over to a server farm or even colocation
site&mdash;I&#39;m convinced that the lack of apparent server compromise on
<a href="http://www.aleph0.com">www.aleph0.com</a> is the simple result of 
three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> as my network 
operating system,</li>
<li>Managing the server myself with no excess features or other administrators
to muck it up, and</li>
<li>A nearly complete lack of content and userbase.</li>

<h2>Vioxx and Patients&#39; Rights</h2>

<p>By now you&#39;ve quite possibly heard that <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6995607/">Vioxx will be returning to the
market</a>.  This has promoted <a
href="http://www.newsday.com/news/printedition/health/ny-hssafe204151940feb20,0,1338399.story">understandable
shock about the FDA&#39;s role in public protection</a>, and physicians are
denouncing the decisions.</p>

<p>Why do they consider this a bad thing?  The Food and Drug Administration is
expected to protect the public by banning dangerous pharmaceuticals, or by 
disallowing them in the first place.  The current outrage suggests that 
they&#39;re simply catering to the drug companies, to industry that stands to
make more money if they can sell they&#39;re drugs.  I have no idea if 
that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing, or if that&#39;s what they did when they
approved Vioxx and other COX-2 inhibitors in the first place.</p>

<p>I do believe, however, that this is in fact a success for patients and their
physicians.  The fact remains that there are patients who respond better to 
COX-2 inhibitors than to any other drug available, and there are those who
should heed the risks of cardiac complications discovered in the recent 
studies.  It&#39;s called an informed decision, and it&#39;s what people should
be making with the help of their doctor, rather than having the decision made
in advance by the government.  (It may be noted at this point that some of these
are the same activists who said the FDA should be dissolved back when Vioxx
was originally pulled from the market.)</p>

<p>There are physicians who aren&#39;t particularly interested in patient
education, and certainly some of those would rather have the excuse to simply
say, &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, but the federal government has decided you can&#39;t
take Vioxx.  Have some ibuprofen.&rdquo;  Personally, I&#39;m happy that I have
the opportunity to discuss a patient&#39;s choices instead of simply forcing
one.</p>

<h2>Updating the classics</h2>

<p><a href="http://countdown.msnbc.com">Countdown with Ken Olbermann</a> and
tons of other places are reporting on a new television program this fall:
<a href="http://www.nypost.com/commentary/22021.htm">Loonatics, an update of
the Looney Tunes characters</a> with &ldquo;newer&rdquo; art, a setting in the
year 2772, and superpowers of some kind.  This includes the possibility of
&ldquo;Buzz Bunny&rdquo; and more.  Wow.  I honestly didn&#39;t know where to
start.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem with such updates, at least from my point of view.
See, one of the quotes from Warner Bros. Animation President Sander Schwarz is
meant to alleviate concerns from us old-timers:  &ldquo;[T]hese are cartoons.
Lighten up!  They&#39;re fun and the existence of one doesn&#39;t preclude the
existence of another.&rdquo;  Sure, that&#39;s true.  Unlike the Starbucks v.
Kahl&uacute;a issue I mentioned earlier, no one here is trying to take away any
real kind of market share, and if nothing else I can revel in what&#39;s likely
to be a ton of <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AYJXS">Golden
Collection</a> volumes.</p>

<p>The problem I have here is merely one of ego, quite related to the Kicking
and Screaming issue I mentioned a while back.  Quite simply, on the off chance
that this new show is a minor success (but really sucks), some kid&#39;s going
to ask me at some point who my favorite cartoon character is.  I suggest Bugs
Bunny (or, more likely, Daffy Duck), and the naive child takes me to be a hip
adult who knows what&#39;s cool and gets it more than any other adult in the
world.</p>

<p>Come on, am I really going to have to put up with that?</p>

href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com">MSNBC</a>, <a 
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6986467/">Starbucks will begin selling a
coffee-flavored liqueur</a>.  They&#39;re smart enough to really only use the
brand, not multiple-per-intersection stores;  Starbucks Coffee Liqueur will
be sold in liquor stores, bars, restaurants, and, I assume, anywhere you can
pick up ridiculously overpriced goods.</p>

<p>Let me be fair.  Back in the day when I used caffeine, I&#39;m sure I
contributed more than my fair share to <a 
href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a>&#39;s rapidly ascending profits.
That was, however, more to do with convenience than quality, mostly since they
run the &ldquo;coffee shop&rdquo; on the medical school campus.  When there was 
a long line for the main cafeteria (which contained the unsurprisingly better
&ldquo;school-branded&rdquo;&mdash;and thus cheaper&mdash;coffee), or I was out 
of decent coffee for the pot in my lab, I&#39;d pay for my humongous cuppajoe 
and get out of there.  Oh, it was swill&mdash;I commented on more than one 
occasion about it being &ldquo;the worst cup of coffee I&#39;d ever 
had&mdash;but it was caffeine, and I took it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t drink much liqueur.  Well, any.  Never really liked the whole
&ldquo;dessert drink&rdquo; idea of a drink sweeter than it was alcoholic.
That said, I&#39;ve had the occasional coffee or hot chocolate with some 
schnapps (not really liqueur, but meh) or (gasp) irish creme.  Lindsey has white
russians, so she&#39;s the <a href="http://www.kahlua.com">Kahl&uacute;a</a> 
drinker in the house.  I think it&#39;s just a shame that a generation of 
college-age pansies are going to end up thinking it&#39;s called 
&ldquo;Starbucks&rdquo; (and that it tastes terrible but you&#39;re supposed to
like it) instead of Kahl&uacute;a&mdash;not to mention starting to refer to
a double of anything as a &ldquo;venti&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You have to wonder if I&#39;d dislike Starbucks so much if their wireless
internet access were free&hellip;.</p>

<h2>More on Microsoft AntiSpyware</h2>

<p>So I&#39;ve downloaded and started using <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx">Microsoft
AntiSpyware Beta 1</a> (apparently the only beta they&#39;re going to have).  It
actually seems to be a fairly complete project, though it does seem to contain
just a few interface bugs.  (From the little I know about Windows GUI
programming, actually, these are bugs that should actually be <em>difficult</em>
to make, like the vertical scrollbar not performing quite right. You have to
wonder if Microsoft inserts these just so people will remember it&#39;s 
beta.)</p>

<p>Overall, a much more satisfying product than <a
href="http://www.lavasoft.com/software/adaware/">Ad-Aware Personal</a>.  A 
while back, <a 
href="http://www.flexbeta.net/main/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=84">Flexbeta&#39;s
comparison of MS AntiSpyware, Ad-Aware, and Spybot Search &amp; Destroy</a> was
touted as showing MS&#39;s product as not up to par;  in fact, it compared more
than favorably with the other two.  Each of them found spyware the others did
not;  AntiSpyware found more that the others didn&#39;t, and I&#39;m guessing
that those who leave the &ldquo;send information to Microsoft&rdquo; feature
turned on are the same who will get a decent amount of spyware, further closing 
that gap (if it hasn't closed already).  The article does, perhaps wisely,
go on to suggest that no matter which tool you use, you should also use another;
I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s warranted for the more conscientious user.</p>

<p>PC World also has <a 
href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1749938,00.asp">a review of MS 
AntiSpyware</a>, which they compare to <a
href="http://webroot.com/products/spysweeper/">Webroot&#39;s Spy Sweeper</a>,
a non-free program with a limited trial.  They did half the test that Flexbeta
performed, running Spy Sweeper after AntiSpyware, and found (surprise) Spy
Sweeper to find extra &ldquo;infections&rdquo;; no mention of doing the test in
reverse.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never used Spy Sweeper or <a 
href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html">Spybot S&amp;D</a>, though
I&#39;m beginning to wish I&#39;d replaced Ad-aware with Spybot earlier.  Still,
Microsoft&#39;s product is looking reasonably good to me, and I have little
reason to use another on my Windows system.  (To be honest, if there were still 
a no-cost AntiVirus from Microsoft, I&#39;d probably use it, too;  the interface
for <a href="http://www.clamwin.com">ClamWin</a> just isn&#39;t quite up to 
par.  <a 
href="http://unix.ittoolbox.com/news/dispnews.asp?i=126383&amp;t=6">MS is 
supposedly working on an anti-virus solution</a>, but it looks unlikely that
it will be free to download.  If only they still made the version that came 
with Windows 3.1&hellip;.)</p>

<h2>Microsoft to release free antispyware</h2>

<p>An <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com">MSNBC</a> story reports that <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6973740/">Microsoft AntiSpyware&#39;s final
version will be free</a> to download.  This is a good thing (lower case, that
is), and it should bring some nice light to the question of spyware and adware.
The article very appropriately gives quotes from Bill Gates&#39;s speech
today, including his note that the capability is &ldquo;a burning need for
[their] users&rdquo;.  Very good.</p>

<p>The article then goes on to talk about the beta testing that went into it,
along with how, even in the final version, &ldquo;[t]he program also includes
a feature where users can submit information back to Microsoft so that it keeps
up with the latest threats.&rdquo;  Hey, that&#39;s great:  Mr. Gates, I think
someone may be spying on me&mdash;can you take a look at my computer for me?
Oh, and don&#39;t look in the folder labelled &ldquo;Chris&#39;s Private 
Stuff&rdquo;, okay?</p>

<p>Yeah, I know what they&#39;re getting at, and it&#39;s really a necessary
part of a good operation like this&mdash;but I hope the irony is as clear to
everyone else.  Wouldn&#39;t want to beat anyone over the head to make a point.
Hell, I&#39;ll probably even download the final version for my last remaining
Windows install;  at least I can hope that if there&#39;s not a for-fee version
they won&#39;t obviously cripple the free product like <a
href="http://www.lavasoft.com/software/adaware/">Ad-aware</a> does.</p>

<h2>LotGD, cont.</h2>

<p>All right, it seems my endorsement of Legend of the Green Dragon was a bit
premature.  As I mentioned yesterday, I was concerned about the constant
begging for funding, but was willing to deal with it for a short time.  After
playing last night, however, I began to notice that there were actually areas
of the game I couldn&#39;t access without making a &ldquo;donation&rdquo;.
So, meh.</p>

<p>Please note that I&#39;m not suggesting people providing a service (as
those at lotgd.net are doing) shouldn&#39;t charge&mdash;they have every right
to.  My only reason for mentioning my displeasure with it is that it wasn&#39;t
what I expected, and I had previously mentioned it as being a fun thing.  Now,
not so much.</p>

<p>So, I decided to take a look at the LORD incarnation I mentioned at <a
href="http://lord.nuklear.org">lord.nuklear.org</a>.  All well and good, but it
turns out that it&#39;s just a Java telnet program into their BBS, not really
a web version.  Again, meh.</p>

<p>If I get motivated enough, maybe I&#39;ll take the LotGD code and install it
on this site just to play a nice little game or two.  To be honest, that seems
rather unlikely, as it doesn&#39;t (by itself) seem like a good enough reason
to install PHP and MySQL, but we&#39;ll see.  It&#39;s not like I really
<em>need</em> extra things to take up my time&hellip;.</p>

<div class="blog">

<h2>LotGD</h2>

<p>Back in the day, when men were men and 1400 baud modems roamed the InterNet,
I first came close to getting &ldquo;on-line&rdquo;.  In actuality, I visited
a dozen or so local BBSs in and around Winter Haven and Lakeland, Florida;  I
was Hrothgar (or maybe it was Heremond&mdash;I can never remember which was
which), and didn&#39;t even know what the InterNet was.  Usually I just tried
in vain to save up download time in the Time Bank, just enough so I could get
an uninterrupted hour to download that one megabyte bitmap file that just
<em>had</em> to be hot, but turned out to be yet another hand-sketched
fantasy dragon princess.  Actually, the only time I had any real contact with
a network that wasn&#39;t between a grand total of two computers was when my
friend Jonathon got a list of free ftp sites.  We learned the very basics of
how to use the command-line client, and when one of the sites stopped 
responding we thought we had shut down the government of Ecuador and maybe
we&#39;d better stop while we could.</p>

<p>I never got into chatting with people who lived a local call away;  in fact,
I still don&#39;t chat or <code>ytalk</code> or &ldquo;instant message&rdquo; 
or whatever they&#39;re calling it these days.  What I did enjoy, however,
were door games.  The king of them all was Legend of the Red
Dragon, or LORD.  (In fact, a few years later I found that there are <a
href="http://www.3dham.com/telnet.html">BBSs you can telnet into to play
LORD</a>.  Did it a couple of times, but telnet is <em>so</em> 1995.)</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s still around, but a new, web-based, open-source clone is
now available.  Appropriately named, <a
href="http://www.lotgd.net">Legend of the Green Dragon</a> (which they
abbreviate LoGD;  I prefer LotGD since I can then remember the website) retains
the charm of the original&mdash;I&#39;ve been putting in half an hour to an
hour for each of the last couple of days.  I think the worst downside of this
particular incarnation is the apparent need of every server to solicit funds;
to be honest, I&#39;m not usually much of a community participant in places 
like that.  I understand the need to pay for bandwidth, but the constant
begging just starts seeming trite after a while.</p>

<p>One other option I should therefore mention is <a
href="http://lord.nuklear.org/">Nuklear LORD</a>.  From first glance, it&#39;s
another web incarnation of LORD, though not open source.  (The 
sysop&mdash;wow, didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever need that term 
again&mdash;actually addresses this issue reasonably well in the <a 
href="http://lord.nuklear.org/faq.html">Nuklear LORD FAQ</a>.)  I haven&#39;t
tried it, but may just switch over to that at some point if lotgd.net ever
becomes too annoying.</p>

<p>And now, back to the realm&hellip;</p>

<h2>Medical malpractice</h2>

<p>No, I&#39;m not being sued just yet.  Today, however, was the first seminar
of the GPSS (Graduate and Professional Student Senate) Malpractice Series, in
this case a physician, pharmacologist, and Ph.D. of some kind who planned to
discuss medical malpractice.  The seminar itself was a total bust&mdash;it&#39;s
safe to say that the only thing I learned was that the average settlement for a
&ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; lawssuit (malpractice or otherwise) is twenty to thirty
thousand dollars.  (Not that anyone discussed what was considered a
&ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; suit, but meh.)</p>

<p>The whole concept did get me thinking, though, and a letter to the editor in
this month&#39;s <a href="http://www.southerncaliforniaphysician.com">Southern
California Physician</a> magazine had some interesting information: five percent
of physicians are responsible for 80 percent of malpractice awards.  This first
bolsters two of my concerns about malpractice reform:  that it makes it easier
for incompetent physicians to keep practicing, and that by supporting such
reform physicians will be seen by the public as trying to evade 
responsibility.</p>

<p>What the letter doesn&#39;t note, however, is how many physicians are sued
without having to pay an award&mdash;maybe this is the &ldquo;nuisance 
suit&rdquo; mentioned earlier.  Do I believe that physicians are sometimes
sued for no good reason?  Yes.  Do I believe that given any hypothetical
&ldquo;cap&rdquo; on malpractice awards, there is some sort of malpractice a
physician can perform that should be awarded more than that cap?  
Absolutely.</p>

<p>Is there any possibility that it&#39;s the legal system, and not the specific
issue of malpractice, that needs to be reformed?</p>

<h2>Day Off</h2>

<p>Took the day off today.  Slept in, edited some <a
href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a> video, played a lot of <a
href="http://www.wesnoth.org">The Battle for Wesnoth</a>, and watched a few
episodes of <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/WestWing/">The West Wing</a> from
the end of the second to the beginning of the third season.  It was the latter
that made me think about making a quick post.</p>

<p>After September 11, 2001, The West Wing showed what they called a 
&ldquo;play&rdquo;, delaying the start of their third season.  The episode was
called &ldquo;Isaac and Ishmael&rdquo;, and dealt with a lot of questions 
popular among those of us who felt impacted by terrorism for the first time.
It talked about &ldquo;why&rdquo; Muslim extremists and others perform
terrorist acts, a bit of the history of such, and so forth, but also began
addressing the question of civil liberties in a society that&#39;s trying to
stay safe.  The show doesn&#39;t suggest any real answers to most of it, but
re-watching it this evening did have an impact on me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a particularly soft-spoken guy.  People around me are generally 
aware of my views on a variety of issues, though almost as often incorrectly 
assume my opinion before I&#39;ve mentioned it.  (In fact, on multiple 
occasions I&#39;ve been mistaken for a Republican.  Hell, I used to <em>be</em>
a Republican&mdash;ideologically, not registered&mdash;and maybe that&#39;s
one reason for confusion.)  However, there are some things I don&#39;t tend to
speak out about, and there are other things I&#39;m happy to talk about with
just about anyone who will listen, but would rather not mention in writing.</p>

<p>One of those was the staggering decline in civil liberties we&#39;ve been
experiencing over the last few years.  I didn&#39;t want to talk about it
directly, because I&#39;m honestly scared to be identified as any sort of 
&ldquo;troublemaker&rdquo; in that area.  It&#39;s a vicious cycle:  failure to
protest leads to more problems which lead to more fear about speaking up.</p>

<p>Once again, though, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070/">Aaron
Sorkin</a> has shown me the error of my ways.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, 
I&#39;ll be mentioning plenty about the decline in free speech that&#39;s
currently going on in the United States, and will do all I can to change that
trend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m quite aware that my parents&#39; generation has botched the job
quite nicely.  It&#39;s starting to look like students who are now in high
school aren&#39;t going to do any better:  <a 
href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/01/31/students.amendment.ap/index.html">a
poll over the last several months</a> shows, among other travesties, that 
&ldquo;when told of the exact text of the First Amendment, more than 
one in three high school students said it goes &lsquo;too far&rsquo; in the 
rights it guarantees.&rdquo;  How will I deal with that?  By making the most of
the speech I have available to me.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t despair.  This site isn&#39;t undergoing any major reformat of
content.  I&#39;m simply adding a new policy:  I&#39;m not going to keep from
stating opinion because of my fear of its unpopularity or government support.
When I can&#39;t do that anymore, I&#39;ll either be on my way out of the 
jurisdiction of whoever&#39;s doing the oppressing, or I&#39;ll be detained
beyond my control&mdash;hopefully the former.</p>

<p>To be honest, I probably already would have moved, if I weren&#39;t trying 
to finish medical school and if there were <a 
href="http://www.chilis.com">Chili&#39;s</a> restaurants in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>Two site updates</h2>

<p>Just a quick note to point out two smallish updates.  The first could
actually be considered a pretty big deal:  I&#39;ve registered yet another
domain:  norightsreserved.org.  Kinda surprised it wasn&#39;t already taken.
I&#39;ve moved the old No Rights Reserved project (such as it was) to the new
site, and hope to add quite a bit more, like information about why and how to
dedicate works to the public domain.  For the moment, still just an example of
it in use.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also now added a <a 
href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> section to my
<a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/">computing project</a>.  At the 
moment, it&#39;s just a small collection of tips, things I&#39;ve spent some
time figuring out.  With luck, it will save others some time.  Expect it to
grow as I keep playing with my new toy.</p>

<h2>These kids today&hellip;</h2>

<p>Won&#39;t bore you with much this afternoon, but I should mention that I did
fine on the Repro exam I had yesterday.  Not well, mind you, but fine, just
fine.  And, yes, I worked harder than usual so I&#39;ll entirely blame my 
lack of superiority on the remarkably bad faculty we had for this system.
Back in <em>my</em> day we had outstanding, passionate instructors like <a
href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/">Ran Libeskind-Hadas</a> and <a
href="http://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/">Francis Su</a>, instructors who would 
regularly blow your mind before telling you how great you were, even though
you had to walk around <a href="http://www.hmc.edu">Harvey Mudd</a> at seven
in the morning in a olde-tyme El Ni&ntilde;o near-freeze.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#39;m in an odd mood.  Most of that nostalgic talk comes from 
reading a couple of items:  <a
href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/1/29/103757/255">an article on Kuro5hin
talking about dead technologies</a> and <a
href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=136619&amp;cid=11411638">a comment
on Slashdot about how <em>bad</em> kids have it today</a>.  Sure, technology
and progress can be great&mdash;but that really depends on how you define
your terms.</p>

<h2>Repro exam</h2>

<p>So I&#39;m sitting in the school&#39;s computer lab, kinda bored, while
everyone else around is madly cramming for this morning&#39;s reproductive
system exam.  It&#39;s not that I know it all, or that I&#39;m not a crammer;
it&#39;s that I generally don&#39;t tend to stress and freak out during the 
hour or so before the exam.  I&#39;ve already looked at today&#39;s <a
href="http://www.frys.com">Fry&#39;s</a> ad, I&#39;ve played a game of <a
href="http://games.yahoo.com/games/downloads/tx.html">Text Twist</a> (despite
the fact that it only works on Internet Explorer in Windows), checked my <a
href="http://gmail.google.com">Gmail</a> and <a
href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> a few times, and still have eighty
minutes before exam time.  So, I figured I&#39;d do the only other pointless
thing I can think of, update this page.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually been working on it quite a bit (and planning even more)
behind the scenes;  expect some new stuff over the next week or two.  Nothing
mind-blowing, of course, but a slightly updated layout and a much cleaner
operation in general.  Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Alright, I just remembered that I should take a look at <a

I&#39;m sure&hellip;.</p>

<h2>MGM Class Action Lawsuit</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t generally have a problem with frivolous lawsuits.  They make
for entertaining reading and writing, and they usually keep lawyers busy
enough so that I&#39;m not the one being sued.  However, I read today that
<a href="http://mgmdvdsettlement.com/">MGM is settling a DVD class action
suit</a>.  After the initial panic from reading that several of my discs may
be corrupted in some way&mdash;some rumors were that MGM was just taking
pan &amp; scan transfers and slapping letterboxes on them&mdash;I was able to
read <a href="http://www.dvdtalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=402532">a long
thread on DVD Talk</a> that describes that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on at
all.  Turns out <a 
href="http://www.dvdtalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=257634">this was a lawsuit
filed a couple of years ago</a> which just alleges MGM&#39;s description of
&ldquo;widescreen&rdquo; was deceptive.  I&#39;ve seen the diagram in question,
which clearly shows that &ldquo;fullscreen&rdquo; versions are cut off on the
sides and &ldquo;widescreen&rdquo; versions show all of the picture that&#39;s
available.  Unfortunately for this case, that&#39;s not always the way it 
works.  In some movies (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The
Princess Bride</a> was the first one I knew about), the camera actually 
<em>shoots</em> in 4:3, a &ldquo;fullscreen&rdquo; aspect ratio.  However, the
director composes the shot so that it will look good in, say, 1.85:1, and
ignores stuff that would be off the screen in that smaller picture.  Then, at 
the theatre (or somewhere in between), the film is shown with the top and
bottom cut off a bit, as the director intended.  This technique is called 
&ldquo;matting&rdquo;, and it turns out that some movies on DVD have both the
letterboxed and unmatted versions.  Therefore, technically, the unmatted 
versions show more picture, but what every director expects you to watch is
the letterboxed film.  Phew.</p>

<p>So why does this suit bug me?  Because this gives the studios more incentive
to not release letterboxed movies at all, and to stop even trying to educate
the public about the different formats.  MGM is one of the few who has 
explained <em>any</em> reason why letterboxing is better;  if a distributor
tries to change that to &ldquo;because it&#39;s what the director 
<em>wants</em> you to see&rdquo;, then someone&#39;s going to cry about
Greedo shooting first, and everyone&#39;s going to hate widescreen.  Grr.</p>

<p>Oh, and not to mention the fact that I&#39;ve wasted like an hour on this
issue this morning&hellip;.</p>

<h2>The Mysterious Mac Mini</h2>

<p>So I was certainly one of the first &ldquo;regular people&rdquo; (yes, I
do sometimes define myself as such) to pick up a <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a>.  The thing&#39;s quite
cute, and full of surprises.  Personally, though, I really don&#39;t know how
much is the machine and how much is <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a>.  Oh, they&#39;re both quite good,
I suppose, and it&#39;s going to take me a little while to get used to each of
them.</p>

<p>The only overlying downside (&ldquo;overlying downside&rdquo;?  That&#39;s
got an interesting ring to it.) is that the machine itself is quite clearly
made of laptop parts, and operates as you&#39;d expect a laptop to.  I
generally haven&#39;t been discouraged by performance, but the optical drive
(a CD-RW/DVD-ROM) sounds horrendous and is quite slow, pretty much identical to
the DVD-ROM on my <a href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> laptop.  The only 
other performance issues I&#39;ve had so far is the occasional video stutter
in the included &ldquo;MarbleBlast Gold&rdquo; game.</p>

<p>There are a few other things I haven&#39;t figured out, yet, like how to set
a host alias.  For instance, I want to refer to a machine on my local network
as &ldquo;dante&rdquo;, but doing so simply goes to dante.aleph0.com, which
DNS resolves to the same address as my externally-available <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/">www.aleph0.com</a>.  One choice, of course, is
changing the DNS record, but that really shouldn&#39;t be necessary (if only
because I <em>do</em> want people outside my network to think dante.aleph0.com
is the same as www.aleph0.com).</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> or <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> I&#39;d only have to change the 
<code>/etc/hosts</code> file to refer to dante (and dante.aleph0.com) by the
proper internal IP, and I&#39;d be done.  That doesn&#39;t seem to work here.
Okay, technically I&#39;d also have to make sure that 
<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> properly searches &ldquo;file&rdquo; before
&ldquo;bind&rdquo;, but according to OS X&#39;s <code>resolver(5)</code> man
page (and can I even possibly express how thrilled I am that there are man
pages?), the <code>lookup</code> keyword doesn&#39;t even exist.  So no luck
there.  I heard something about using NetInfo instead, but, quite frankly, need
a little more documentation on that before I can figure out what&#39;s going
on.</p>

<p>But enough bitching.  This is a <em>nice</em> system.  In the 
Windows-centric world from which I&#39;m coming, some things are done 
differently, and there are thus things I&#39;ll have to relearn.  I&#39;m 
happy to.  The one advice I can give Apple is this:  you want people to switch.
some of us are fairly Windows-oriented, and already quite knowledgeable.  Give
us just a <em>little</em> more guidance, and you&#39;ll have switchers in
droves.</p>

<h2>One day more&hellip;</h2>

<p>It&#39;s officially confirmed;  my <a 
href="http://www.apple.com/macmini">Mac mini</a> will be available for pickup 
from the <a href="http://www.uscbookstore.com/sections/computers/">USC
Computer Store</a> tomorrow!  I&#39;ve only been waiting for a little over a
week, but it seems like much longer&mdash;and I&#39;m giddy as a schoolgirl.
(Though, no, I&#39;m not wearing any sort of jumper.)  At this point, the thing
would really have to suck to disappoint me.</p>

<p>Mad props to the store, too.  While all the Apple Store locations around 
here went out of their way to be annoyed that I wanted to buy something from
them, the USC Computer Store not only <em>reserved</em> one for me (so I
don&#39;t have to wake up early, though I probably will anyway), but they even
gave me the Apple student discount.  Sure, it&#39;s a paltry $20, but it&#39;ll
go towards a decent Apple keyboard, <a
href="http://www.apple.com/iwork">iWork</a>, or the like.  Turns out I 
don&#39;t need to buy a wireless adapter (yet, at least);  I just set up an
OpenBSD box as a gateway to the rest of my network.  I&#39;ll still have to 
shell out for a keyboard and mouse, though, since I only have one set that have
USB adapters and they&#39;re on the &ldquo;main&rdquo; computer.  I don&#39;t
want to move those, so at least it gives me an excuse to buy a nice Apple 
set.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to try something new with this little box&mdash;treating it
more-or-less professionally&mdash;maybe &ldquo;respectfully&rdquo; is another
word.  I&#39;m going to try not to open it, but take it to an Apple Authorized
Service Center for upgrades.  I&#39;m going to try not to hack it, but just
run OS X as it is.  (Oh, sure, I&#39;ll add software, install X11, and run
plenty of development-type apps that most Mac users don&#39;t, but that&#39;s
not what I&#39;m talking about here.)  In all, I&#39;m going to try to treat
it with the deference a nice piece of engineering deserves, whether others
consider it &ldquo;just a tool&rdquo; or not.</p>

<p>In about three days, ask me if that&#39;s still my plan.  Who 
knows&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Worst Day of the Year</h2>

<p>No, not today, but <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4187183.stm">according to the BBC</a>,
it will be this coming Monday.  It&#39;s not entirely clear if that only refers
to Britain or whether it will be the same for everybody, but it&#39;s not like
I was going to be looking forward to a Monday, anyway.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I can only hope for the best.  We had our second
&ldquo;career day&rdquo; yesterday, in which various hospital departments
attempt to describe their specialties and recruit interest.  It
wasn&#39;t like I was doubting Emergency Medicine as an eventual specialty
choice, but I do like to keep my options open.  Besides, visiting some others
before ending up with the ER docs always makes me that much more certain of
my choice.  Really, no question at this point&mdash;call it 98-99.5% sure
for now, though that tends to fluctuate by a percentage point or two.</p>

<p>There are a few little things I have been wanting to mention.  First, it
turns out that California&#39;s working on <a
href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/sen/sb_0051-0100/sb_96_bill_20050114_introduced.html">a 
law to ban the development of peer-to-peer software that would <em>allow</em>
copyright infringement</a>.  I can only assume they&#39;re getting around the
Betamax case by making this <em>criminal</em>.  Yeah, write a peer-to-peer
program, get jail time and/or a $2,500 fine.  That seems reasonable.  We just
voted to commit three <em>billion</em> dollars to stem cell research, partly
because we wanted to encourage the scientific economy&mdash;so let&#39;s make
sure Computer Science doesn&#39;t count as part of that.</p>

<p>We saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385267/">In Good Company</a>
a few days ago, and it wasn&#39;t bad.  Oh, it wasn&#39;t a super film or
anything, and I still can&#39;t imagine <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0333410/">Topher Grace</a> as anyone other 
than Eric Foreman, and couldn&#39;t even buy him (though his acting was
great) in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181865/">Traffic</a>.  Overall,
three stars&mdash;it&#39;s worth a rental.</p>

<p>Okay, so I&#39;ll leav it at that for now.  Plenty of thoughts in my head,
but plenty more on my plate, too.  (No, I&#39;m not eating dinner.  It&#39;s a
metaphor.)  One of these days, I&#39;ll get around to posting my ranting about
Repro and how it&#39;s taught at Keck.  For the moment, I&#39;m going to surf
and hope I still get my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> on
Saturday.  Oh, don&#39;t worry&mdash;I&#39;m <em>positive</em> I&#39;ll
remember to mention if I do&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Political roundup</h2>

<p>As election season per se is over, this&#39;ll probably be the last 
political post I&#39;ll have for sometime.  The subject of voting 
irregularities seems to have been mostly ignored away, and even <a
href="http://www.msnbc.com/id/6210240/">Keith Olberbann</a> has stopped talking
about it&mdash;since I&#39;m not getting info about it from anywhere, I
can&#39;t exactly post more.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6831621/">Bush has said any Iraq
&ldquo;accountability moment&rdquo; is long past</a>, irrelevant since he was
reelected.  Essentially, his point was that he won the election, so the voters
don&#39;t care about the lack of weapons of mass destruction and have basically
ratified his position on Iraq.  Specifically, &ldquo;The American people
listened to different assessments made about what was taking place in Iraq, and
they looked at the two candidates, and chose me.&rdquo;  First, not everyone
voted for George W. Bush.  A majority did, yes&mdash;I&#39;m not disputing 
that.  The trouble is, Bush doesn&#39;t govern those who voted for him, he
governs all Americans.  Is he going to ignore the wishes of the millions of
Americans who voted for someone else?  I guess I shouldn&#39;t be particularly
surprised, but I didn&#39;t think that was how it worked.  (Not to mention, of
course, that it&#39;s not entirely unbelievable there were people who voted
for Bush <em>despite</em> his Iraq policy rather than <em>because</em> of it.
Oh, well&mdash;I suppose not everyone can make the distinction between 
&ldquo;ad hoc, ergo propter hoc&rdquo; and real life.)</p>

<p>Finally, I never mentioned the <a 
href="http://www.newsweek.com">Newsweek</a> story a few weeks ago which 
includes <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6777696/site/newsweek/">a John
Kerry interview</a> and looks at his plans for another run.  It&#39;s 
interesting to me that anyone talks about his running again.  Sure, he&#39;s
rather young, and may even do relatively well, but I would not have expected 
it.  Did Mondale run again?  Did Carter?  Did George H.W. Bush?  Really odd.
And what about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama?  Surely, Senator, you&#39;re
not expecting to run <em>against</em> two people in your party that are
significantly more charismatic than you?  (On the other hand, I suppose the
Howard Dean campaign demonstrates how far charisma can get one.)  The
story&#39;s an interesting read, but may ask more questions than it 
answers.</p>

<p>My friends know that I&#39;m a bit of an idealist.  I wouldn&#39;t consider
myself an <em>outrageous</em> idealist, but is a decent Jed Bartlett too much
to ask for?  Oh, right.  Yes.</p>

<h2>Mac mini, continued</h2>

<p>So I&#39;m seriously looking at getting one of these little bastards.  Turns
out that the Apple stores won&#39;t be carrying them until the 22nd, but that
does include the USC campus bookstore;  as a student, at least I&#39;ll get
$20 off.  It still beats the 3-4 weeks of shipping that comes with buying it 
online, but I was hoping to check one out <em>today</em>.</p>

<p>So, instead, I&#39;ve been reading about it.  (Yes, I would consider
&ldquo;obsessing&rdquo; too strong a term.)  All standard stuff which any
Mac user would tell you, but a couple of cute little blurbs, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>HDTV sold separately.</li>
<li>Best of all, Mac OS X will never nag you about cleaning up icons on your desktop when you&#39;re in the middle of a train of thought, six chats or a sweet groove.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Mac mini</h2>

<p>Wow.  I am seriously blown away.  Sure, I&#39;m a geek, but I didn&#39;t
expect anything like this.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a rumor for some time that this week (Macworld is either
going on or just finished), <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> would
announce a sub-$500 Mac.  The idea was that so many people loved the <a
href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> and became Mac converts, the only
thing stopping others was the price of the hardware.  It&#39;s certainly the
only thing that&#39;s ever stopped me from buying a Mac once OS X came out.
I honestly believe they&#39;re superior hardware and software, but <em>man</em>
do you pay for the name.</p>

<p>Not anymore.  Today (or recently), Apple announced the <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a>, the sub-$500 Mac that was
rumored.  Sure, it&#39;s not cutting-edge, but it&#39;s not out-of-date, 
either.  The <em>really</em> interesting thing, and the thing that made me
<em>need</em> this machine:  it&#39;s <em>tiny</em>.  Seriously, like half the
size of my <a href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> laptop.  It (of course)
doesn&#39;t come with a monitor, but I&#39;ve got a couple.  The other point,
of course, is that it&#39;s an Apple, so it&#39;s <em>gorgeous</em>.  Take a
look:  <a href="/~chjones/img/macmini.jpg"><img src="/~chjones/img/macmini.jpg" 
alt="Picture of the new Mac mini" /></a></p>

<p>The only bad news is that it&#39;s Apple and it&#39;s brand new&mdash;so
the current online store wait time is 3-4 weeks.  Grrr.  I&#39;m going to head
over to the Pasadena Apple store later today and see if they have one on 
display (and, dare I hope, in stock).  I&#39;ll let you know.</p>

<p>Wow.  (And man, am I a geek.)</p>

<h2>Working hard&hellip;</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, the New Year&#39;s resolutions are going quite well.  Sure, 
I&#39;m dieting again, which is not much fun but doable, but the real surprise
is that I&#39;m actually working fairly hard.  Not by real people standards,
maybe, but certainly by my standards.  I&#39;m trying to do a 40-hour work
week, just as if med school were an actual job, and not do any real work at
home.  For the moment, it seems like a lot of work and is going well&mdash;I
can only hope that replacing my usual end-of-system cramming will still work
out for me.</p>

<p>Because of school, there&#39;s not really much personal news at the moment.
As usual, I&#39;m ridiculously annoyed with my neighbors, I&#39;m working much
harder than I&#39;d like (and not as much as I should), I&#39;m getting more
sleep than I&#39;d like (and not as much as I should), I&#39;m playing <a
href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">Battle for Wesnoth</a> (think turn-based <a 
href="http://www.blizzard.com/war2bne/">WarCraft</a>) <em>way</em> too much,
and, of all things, I haven&#39;t seen a movie in <em>weeks</em>;  since we
got back from Colorado, I think.  (To be fair, I&#39;ve been watching a bit of
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a> and <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203259/">Law &amp; Order: SVU</a>.  Oh, and
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421316/">Committed</a> and <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412175/">Medium</a> aren&#39;t half bad,
either.)</p>

<p>The only real news to mention is the new existence of an <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/zaurus.html">OpenBSD Zaurus port</a>.  Very cool.
It&#39;s still under active development, and hope for more soon.  Note, though,
that this doesn&#39;t (yet) support my SL-5500, but hopefully will before too
long.  In any case, good thing to work on.</p>

<p>The other project I&#39;ve been spending some time on is <a
href="http://medcenter.usc.edu">MedCenter</a>, a USC medical student web site.
I inherited the project, and am using the administration and redesign of it
as my &ldquo;required student project&rdquo;, which is basically a way to make
sure Keck medical students never want to contribute to the community again.
I&#39;m not a huge fan of the site at the moment, but am more annoyed at the
choice of infrastructure&mdash;it&#39;s currently running Microsoft Windows NT 
4.0, and I recently noticed that Microsoft&#39;s end-of-life on supporting NT
4.0 is this month.  Meh.  Maybe we&#39;ll be able to change it to an open
platform, but I have a feeling the school administration will just upgrade it
to 2000 Server.  Again, meh.</p>

<p>Okay, off to play a little.  Have a good one!</p>

<h2>San Francisco update</h2>

<p>I&#39;m staying pretty busy at the moment (among other things, working on
an arrangement of the Beatles&#39; &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo; for Chorda Tympani,
our med school a cappella group), but I just wanted to take this brief moment
to note that I got email from my friend Nestor, who was aboard the USS 
San Francisco when it ran aground (or something) a few days ago.  He&#39;s
fine;  no serious injuries.  It&#39;s a shame to hear that they lost a crew
member, but I&#39;m selfish enough to just be thankful Nestor&#39;s okay.
Okay, that&#39;s it&mdash;back to &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>San Francisco runs aground</h2>

<p>My buddy Nestor&#39;s an engineer onboard the USS San Francisco, a 
fast-attack sub based in Guam that <a 
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6801642/">ran aground yesterday 
afternoon</a>.  They&#39;ve left port only within the last few days (he&#39;s
unable to give out exact dates that they&#39;ll be leaving or returning).  I
sent him an email this morning, but even assuming he&#39;s fine, it may be a 
while before they get back to port and he&#39;s able to check his email.  Just
wish him luck, okay?  Nestor&#39;s one of the good guys.</p>

<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>

<p>So, 2005 is here, and I&#39;m back to lots of things:  dieting, school, and
(therefore) studying hard.  Trying an 8-4 40-hour-a-week business kind of 
thing for school and related stuff (like studying for the USMLE).  I&#39;ll let
you know how it works out.</p>

<p>We started the reproductive system today, which also means we&#39;re back
in gross anatomy for a couple of weeks.  Luckily my cadaver this year (like
last year) is a female, so I didn&#39;t have to dissect a wang.  From the 
reaction of the guys who did, count yourself lucky.  There are other bad things
about the section, though&mdash;not the least of which are cases and quizzes 
that are required and graded, but for which the faculty is opposed to 
distributing answers.  They say it&#39;s because &ldquo;there&#39;s no
standard answer&rdquo;&mdash;I think it&#39;s because the Repro faculty are
lazy.  (The Anatomists are the exception, of course.)</p>

<p>So, back to everything (I&#39;ve got another hour&#39;s worth of work to
do tonight), but I&#39;ll leave you with this disturbing thought:  I actually
read <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=134596&amp;cid=11237088">an 
interesting conversation</a> on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>.
No, really.  Okay, maybe two messages (as that&#39;s all that&#39;s really 
interesting) can&#39;t be called a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo;, but it&#39;s
nice to so neatly condense the two important points of the argument about
&ldquo;piracy&rdquo; or &ldquo;information liberation&rdquo; (depending on
your stance).  Have a nice read.</p>

<h2>Rainy days</h2>

<p>Pretty rainy in Southern California, but I seriously need to say this to
other Angelinos: suck it up.  Wow&mdash;three days in a row of rain?  Must be
the end of the world.  MSNBC cites &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; of car accidents that
have occurred because of the rain over the last couple of days;  I don&#39;t
suppose that would be because Southern Californians have no idea how to drive
in the rain.  (I&#39;ll help you out a little here&mdash;there&#39;s actually
a pedal <em>beside</em> the gas that you can use, too.)  Lindsey even had to
leave for work an extra ten minutes early because it was 
raining&mdash;there&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t happen in Florida.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6765565/">Jerry Orbach died.</a>
He&#39;s certainly the most famous detective, Lenny Briscoe, from the <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844/">Law &amp; Order</a> franchise.
I&#39;m not normally much of a celebrity-gusher, but this seems like one of the
good guys.  Pretty classic way to go, unfortunately, for an older guy:  prostate
cancer.  Hey, I don&#39;t like the screenings any more than others, but it
keeps getting underscored as necessary&hellip;.</p>

<p>Also wanted to send a quick shout-out to my buddy Nestor in Guam.  He&#39;s
advancing nicely in the Navy&#39;s nuclear sub program, and I wish him luck.  I
actually feel kind of bad, since I initially discouraged him from joining up a
couple of years ago, but he actually seems pretty happy with it now.  Here&#39;s
to you, buddy!</p>

<h2>Back from Colorado</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t know what it is that makes me sick on the way home from trips,
but it&#39;s happened two of the last three plane flights I&#39;ve had.  So
I feel like crap (though worlds better than last night), and still feel like
I have a ton of stuff to get through before school starts again in a week.
Grr.  Oh, well&mdash;I do have a decent amount of gifts, including enough DVD
box sets to watch for about three days straight, so I&#39;ll keep this 
relatively brief and just comment on some interesting news and pseudo-news.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting stories I read this morning:  <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6761326/">Ecstacy to be tested on terminal
cancer patients</a>, a la <a href="http://www.msnbc.com">MSNBC</a>.  No, it
doesn&#39;t do anything to combat the cancer, but it does help as palliative
care.  Nice to see actual drug studies being done to make a person&#39;s last
days more pleasant.  Though the article refers to MDMA as 
&ldquo;ego-friendly&rdquo; (and I suppose it is, compared to LSD), I would 
still be concerned that family wouldn&#39;t be too happy about their dying 
grandmother gushing over them if that weren&#39;t normally her style.  Then
again, maybe they would.</p>

<p>Ken Olbermann&#39;s column <a 
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6210240/">Bloggermann</a> is still talking 
about the Ohio &ldquo;recount&rdquo;.  Apparently, just before Christmas there
was a Kerry lawyer who mentioned the importance of &ldquo;preserving
evidence&rdquo;, while of course not supporting the idea that it would make any
difference in the election.  There wasn&#39;t anything all that surprising in
the resulting editorial, but I particularly appreciated Ken&#39;s 
summary: &ldquo;The Kerry campaign spent much of 2004 being accused by its critics of trying to be all things to all people. It seems poised to continue to wear the bull's eye well into the New Year.&rdquo;  I suppose it doesn&#39;t help
that I&#39;m planning to watch <em>way</em> too much <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">West Wing</a> over the next week,
and I&#39;ll be constantly comparing that President to the real-life one.</p>

<p>Of course the largest news event of the weekend was the earthquake and 
resulting tsunami in East Asia.  Guam&#39;s fine, which has effectively meant
any chance of my personally knowing a victim has dropped to zero;  therefore,
please forgive me for my largest concern being the fate of <a
href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org/arthurclarke/biography.html">Arthur C.
Clarke</a>, who lives in Sri Lanka.  <a
href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org/">According to the front page of his
foundation&#39;s site</a>, he&#39;s apparently fine.</p>

<p>On the lighter side, <a 
href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/html/weasel_poll_results.html">Dilbert&#39;s
annual weasle awards</a> have been named.  Scott Adams makes the point that 
they&#39;re not necessarily his view of the world&mdash;in fact, &ldquo;they
represent a view of the world that&#39;s about as creepy as if you woke up
one night and found Michael Moore in you bedroom wearing nothing but a baseball
cap.&rdquo;  Thanks, Scott.  That image is going to haunt me for weeks.</p>

<p>The last story I&#39;d like to comment on (hey, I haven&#39;t posted all
week, okay?) is from <a href="http://www.nature.com">Nature</a>, and seems to
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041220/full/041220-12.html">point out
a theory of quantum darwinism</a>, specifically how things can change 
dramatically and near-randomly at the extreme microscopic level and remain
&ldquo;exactly&rdquo; the same at the visible level.  Think of it this way:
Observation changes the observed object.  You give somebody directions to your
abode, saying &ldquo;take a left at the red house&rdquo;.  Why do we not
consider the possibility that the house is green, or blue, or a car, by the 
time our visitor notices it?  Or, as <a
href="http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/">Heinlein</a> would rather us think,
if events and choices can make different universes, how can an ostensibly 
infinite number of possible choices lead to a rather small number of universes?
Sorry to go all philosiphical, but at least I threw some science fiction in
there.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ll just throw a shout-out to a new service I discovered a
couple weeks ago:  <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.  It&#39;s
considered a &ldquo;social bookmarks manager&rdquo;, but I just like the 
ease-of-use and method for putting bookmarks online.  Very handy.</p>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all for now.  I&#39;ve spent the last hour reading news and
writing this, so it&#39;s time to get some work done.  Off to the TV&hellip;</p>

<h2>In Colorado</h2>

<p>So we&#39;re at Lindsey&#39;s mom&#39;s in Longmont, Colorado, just outside
Boulder.  As always seems to happen, I felt like crap on the first day of
travel, slept, and now I&#39;m feeling better.  On the other hand, 
Lindsey&#39;s got a cold and a sinus infection, so we spent the morning at a
local clinic and are trying desperately to get some relaxation time in.  Her
sister and stepdad will get here this afternoon, and we&#39;ll (hopefully) have
a decent dinner and do just a little last-minute shopping.</p>

<p>Lindsey&#39;s family is always disturbingly good to me at Xmas-time.
(&ldquo;Disturbing&rdquo; only because they&#39;re significantly better to me
than <em>my</em> family is.)  I&#39;ll get some nice little gifts, I&#39;m 
sure, and I&#39;m sure some of them will be DVDs.  Oh, I&#39;m in no way
complaining&mdash;the best gift I&#39;m getting from my mother is some book
about how doctors connect with their patients.  Hmm, haven&#39;t heard
<em>that</em> one before.</p>

<p>Not sure when I&#39;ll post again&mdash;it&#39;s easy here, as Lindsey&#39;s
family has a nice insecure wireless network set up&mdash;but I don&#39;t have
a good idea of when my free time will be.</p>

<p>Hope all is well with you, and happy holidays/solstice/vactaion!</p>

<h2>EPIC 2014</h2>

<p>Just ran into <a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/epic/">this site</a>
(thanks to <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>), a &ldquo;future
history&rdquo; (I assume with apologies to Robert Heinlein) of the media, a
short documentary, a <span class="longtitle">1984</span> for the 
news-conscious among us today.  Please check it out&mdash;it&#39;s one of the 
first things on the web in a long time that&#39;s had any actual 
<em>meaning</em> to me.</p>

<p>The movie&#39;s apparently been around for a while, but the Slashdot effect
has moved them onto a dozen servers&mdash;it should only get better, but just
in case you can&#39;t find them (or want to save them, as I did), the movie
files are below.  Note that these aren&#39;t in a great format for 
presentation (and are on a slow connection);  I&#39;d recommend just
downloading them here and watching them later from your machine.  Both are
necessary to watch the movie.  Drop &#39;em into the same directory and load
the first one.</p>

<h2>Drugs to make you smarter</h2>

<p><a 
href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-smartdrugs20dec20.story">Interesting
little story in the Los Angeles Times</a> today about drugs that sharpen 
one&#39;s mind (in a good way).  Mostly concentrating on drugs like <a
href="http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofax/ritalin.html">Ritalin</a> used for
off-label purposes, but legal.  I&#39;m already expecting a slew of medical
students to head over to campus health and beg for prescriptions before the
next set of exams.  (On the other hand, is there any particular time a med
student <em>doesn&#39;t</em> need to be concentrating?)</p>

<p>Heard a story last year that back in the day it was common for campus
infirmaries to hand out amphetamines at a student&#39;s request.  Relatively
shocking now, but why is this any different?  Students (and doctors) will
most certainly start taking some of these drugs (or already are), and then
twenty years from now we&#39;ll learn about all sorts of psychoses and other
side effects that show the drug&mdash;surprise&mdash;does more harm than good.
I can&#39;t imagine taking it;  the only question that comes up is whether 
I&#39;ll be at a disadvantage if I don&#39;t.</p>

<h2>Boulder, MyDomain, and &ldquo;vacation&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Vacation&#39;s here. (Hey, three updates today, could you have guessed?)
Not exactly and end for work, though.  I picked up some USMLE Step 1 prep books
while we were out at <a href="http://www.borders.com">Borders</a> today, which
is the closest I&#39;ve yet come to studying for the exam I&#39;ll have to take
before starting 3rd year.  I&#39;ll be likely to just read through half of 
those&mdash;the other half make up about 3100 practice questions.  That&#39;s
a thousand more than I could have gotten from <a 
href="http://www.kaptest.com/">Kaplan&#39;s</a> Qbank, and at a quarter to a
third of the price.  We&#39;ll see how that goes.</p>

<p>We&#39;re headed to Colorado on Wednesday, but I have a bit of work to do
before then.  I have to put together a guide for later AMA Logistics Committee
chairs, but that shouldn&#39;t take long.  I&#39;m more concerned about the
things I <em>didn&#39;t</em> expect to have to deal with, things like the
latest problems with <a href="http://christianjones.md">christianjones.md</a>.
I have no idea what went wrong, but I was just checking on it last night and
noticed it&#39;s address&mdash;or even entry&mdash;wasn&#39;t being propagated
to nameservers from the registrar.  I put in quite a bit of time and $24.95 to
get the nameservers transferred from <a 
href="http://www.mydomain.com">MyDomain</a>, the site&#39;s 
&ldquo;administrator&rdquo; (and I use the term as loosely as possible) to the
outstanding <a href="http://www.dyndns.org">DynDNS</a>, whom I&#39;ve used
ever since I first had a high-speed dynamic connection back in 1999.  MyDomain
still hasn&#39;t explained what the problem was&mdash;my first message to them
asking about the problem informed me that &ldquo;You will need to allow approx.
72 hours for the nameservers to propagate.&rdquo;  Thanks, 
&ldquo;Rosemary&rdquo;&mdash;but that bears very little resemblance to even
talking about the problem I was having.  I can&#39;t stress enough that it
would be a good idea to stay away from these people, but I&#39;ve begged for a
direct phone number&mdash;if I get one, I&#39;ll be sure to make it available
to others with the same problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to get some good web site stuff done, but I honestly don&#39;t
know when that&#39;ll happen.  If anything, it&#39;ll have to be 
Real Soon Now&trade;, since the first priority has to be to clean up this
place&mdash;it&#39;s been a bit messy for, oh, the past few weeks/months/etc.
We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>I want to end tonight with just a quick recommendation to check out my
buddy <a href="http://dan.whatstudios.net/">Dan Warren&#39;s Music Page</a>.
Dan and I chatted occasionally in grad school at <a 
href="http://www.ufl.edu/">UF</a>, and despite the facts that I don&#39;t tend
to keep in touch with people and my guess would be that Dan doesn&#39;t either,
he&#39;s about the only person I keep in touch with from back then.  Long story
short, I&#39;m just learning Dan has interests outside of math, and his musical
tastes are both eclectic and cool.  (How many other people would recognize the
&ldquo;Eli&#39;s coming&rdquo; quote occasionally at the top of this page as
being a <a href="http://www.threedognight.com/">Three Dog Night</a> product?  
Well, okay, maybe quite a few, but not the ones I tend to have the benefit of 
hanging around.)  Anyway, check out the page&mdash;I&#39;m a fan.</p>

<h2>Lemony Snicket and more</h2>

<p>Watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0339291/">Lemony Snicket&#39;s A
Series of Unfortunate Events</a> today.  Not bad, and surprisingly good and 
dark for what&#39;s likely to be considered a &ldquo;family film&rdquo;.  Three
stars.  Got to see trailers for the remade <a
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0367594/">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>,
next summer&#39;s new <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0407304/">War of the
Worlds</a>, and a new horrible-looking <a
href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0002071/">Will Ferrel</a> movie.</p>

<p>Okay, technically the Ferrel movie doesn&#39;t look horrible, but they
committed an atrocious blasphemy&mdash;they named it <a
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0384642/">Kicking &amp; Screaming</a>.  My heart
crushed.  See, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0113537/">Kicking and
Screaming</a> is the name of what may very well be my favorite movie, an
outstanding flick about a few just-out-of-college guys who have no idea what to
do with their lives.  One of my ten or fifteen 5-star moves, and (as I said)
maybe my favorite ever.  So just imagine the looks I get from friends,
colleagues, patients, and anyone else who asks what my favorite movie is, and
then thinks it&#39;s a Will Ferrel movie about a dad who&#39;s a hardcore coach
of his son&#39;s soccer team.  It just hurts to think about it.</p>

<p>Saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0372183/">The Bourne Supremacy</a>
yesterday, and was mildly impressed.  Just as well-made as <a
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0258463/">the first one</a>, but slightly less
interesting.  I just didn&#39;t care as much.  Still, three stars.  Also
watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0265208/">The Girl Next Door</a>, and
was pleasantly surprised.  I had expected a teenage-aimed hormone-infested
comedy, but it was actually good, funny, and actually had a <em>point</em>.
Still, nothing all that impressive, just better than my expectations.  Three
stars, but you should know that Lindsey gave it four, somewhat to my 
surprise.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more or less in the middle of <a 
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0271259/">Welcome to Collinwood</a>, a bumbling
thief movie that&#39;s not done by the Coen brothers, but might as well be (it
even has <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000123/">George Clooney</a> in it).
Just a little bored with movies at the moment, so I&#39;ll finish watching it
and write more later.  While I&#39;m at it, I should mention that I just 
learned the short-lived puppets-as-actually-existant Fox comedy <a 
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0280257/">Greg the Bunny</a> as well as the first
season of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0364828/">Las Vegas</a> are (or will
soon be) available on DVD.  Not bored enough to resist slapping them into the
<a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> queue.</p>

<h2>Bush Named Time&#39;s Person of the Year</h2>

<p>In a courageous and unexpected move, <a href="http://www.time.com/">Time
Magazine</a> has <a href="http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/2004/">named
President George W. Bush its 2004 Person of the Year</a>.  It&#39;s really an
impressive move for Time, who usually picks, well, <a
href="http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/archive/covers/2000.html">George
W. Bush</a>, <a 
href="http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/archive/covers/1990.html">his 
dad</a>, or <a 
href="http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/archive/covers/1992.html">other
 presidents</a>.  They cite &ldquo;sticking to his guns&rdquo; as one of the
outstanding qualities that contributed to his selection.  Hey, I can be a real
asshole, and I don&#39;t change my mind that easily either&mdash;can <em>I</em>
be Man of the Year?  (Patience, I suppose, may be in order, but I&#39;m not 
sure that would enhance my qualifications.)</p>

<p>To be fair, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6734249/">MSNBC&#39;s
story on the choice</a> notes that the Time staff said the Person should be 
the one &ldquo;who most affected the news and our lives, for good or for ill, 
and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse&rdquo;.
This may, then, very well be an appropriate choice that I shouldn&#39;t make
fun of&mdash;but that&#39;s not particularly likely, is it?</p>

<h2>Pass=Winter break</h2>

<p>Well, I passed, and it&#39;s time to start relaxing (or at least 
&ldquo;relaxing some more&rdquo;).  The test wasn&#39;t too bad, considering,
or at least I didn&#39;t think so.  Considering what?  Considering I didn&#39;t
get any serious studying started until Monday.  Considering everyone else 
seemed to think it was harder than I did (though I&#39;m sure most of them will
have scored better than me).  Considering the first two years at Keck are
pass-fail.</p>

<p>I heard for the first time this year a little &ldquo;equation&rdquo; that 
makes me wince:  P=MD.  That&#39;s right, you &ldquo;just have to pass&rdquo;,
which is usually somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy percent.</p>

<p>I should mention, in the interest of full disclosure (don&#39;t you love
that phrase?), that I benefit directly from this policy:  my exam scores are
routinely in the 70-80% range, and my transcript will look remarkably similar
to someone who&#39;s aced all his exams.  That said, I&#39;m not sure pass-fail
is such a great thing.</p>

<p>Oh, I&#39;m not suggesting that doctors shouldn&#39;t be graded on
a pass-fail basis;  in my little world, that&#39;s exactly what doctoring is.
There&#39;s an argument, then, that med students should be trained in the same
way.  The flaw is this:  a doctor passes when a patient is cured, survives,
and/or so forth.  A med student passes with a 70.  In my experience, not much
more than a 70.  And here&#39;s the rub:  that&#39;s all we&#39;re shooting 
for.</p>

<p>P=MD, and you don&#39;t have to work as hard as those people who got a 
ninety.  P=MD, and your residency will be as good as anyone else&#39;s.  Just
not sure if that&#39;s the motivation we should be going for.  Maybe, though,
&ldquo;do as little as possible to get the job done&rdquo; is fairly apt for
medicine today.  Hmm.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m ranting, why&#39;s it so freaking hard to just park in front
of your own house?</p>

<h2>Not a lot to talk about&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;but I&#39;ll ramble on for a while anyway.  Tomorrow&#39;s the
Endocrine system exam, and I&#39;m hoping to pass.  Not sacrificing any cute
little animals or anything, but hoping.  I&#39;ve studied pretty hard for the
last several days (though admittedly almost none for the last several weeks), 
but rumor has it that this is the one several people failed last year.  Wish
me luck.</p>

<p>Took a break tonight to watch <a
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0326856/">Envy</a>.  Wow.  Lindsey went so far as
to declare it the worst movie she&#39;s ever seen, but I&#39;ve seen <a
href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0092603/">Babette&#39;s Feast</a>, so the Jack
Black vehicle still gets two stars in my book, and a simple warning&mdash;avoid
unless your being paid to watch it.</p>

<p>Still have four more movies sitting around the house, as well as a couple 
that have been on the Tivo for as much as a few weeks.  I&#39;ll probably get 
to them next week&mdash;I&#39;ve got a few days off before we head to Colorado
to visit Lindsey&#39;s mom and stepdad, and not too much work to do in that
spare time.  School starts back a depressingly early January 3, but I&#39;m
sure I&#39;ll be ready for it by that time.</p>

<p>For now, I&#39;m tired and I&#39;ve got an exam in the morning.  I&#39;ll
sign off by saying that the cheating discussion we had a couple of weeks ago
has apparently &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; with the simple requirement that we
sit every other seat in the testing hall.  Yeah, that should fix 
everything.</p>

<h2>Short election news</h2>

<p>Well, the &ldquo;recount&rdquo; <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6210240/">is apparently still going on</a>.
The quick note I wanted to post, though, is that apparently <a
href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/587/5134791.html">a Minnesota elector
accidentally voted for &ldquo;John Ewards&rdquo; instead of Kerry.</a>
Seriously, at this point, would the Democrats have won even if Bush

<h2>Open Source Concerns&hellip;</h2>

<p>I&#39;m a supporter of <a 
href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">open source</a> software
(which is also sometimes called <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> software.  I tend to
prefer (only on a personal level, not an evangelical one) that information be 
licensed under <a 
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD-style</a>
licenses to being licensed under slightly more restrictive <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>-style licenses.  (Of 
course, I <em>really</em> prefer releasing software into the public domain, as
I do with all of mine, but not being evangelistic about it, I certainly 
don&#39;t insist that others do the same.</p>

<p>The upshot is that I use free and open-source software wherever possible.
A grand total of two of my computers (my laptop and my primary desktop) have
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp">Windows XP</a> installed on them,
and now that I&#39;ve finished my work with the latest AMA conference, it 
won&#39;t be on my laptop anymore.  Everything else is running <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, and even my main desktop doesn&#39;t
use any software I&#39;ve actually <em>paid</em> for (which, of course, 
isn&#39;t the same as free- or open-source-only).  The goal is to mostly finish
the switch by May (when the next version of OpenBSD will be released), and 
then only use Windows when I have to assure compatibility with a larger
group (such as at the AMA conferences).  I&#39;m not suggesting I&#39;ll be
able to make the goal of a total switch to free software (a good Java VM and
Flash plugin standout as things to worry about), but that&#39;s the goal.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an advocate (without being a zealot) wherever possible&mdash;I even
have several <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu Linux</a> discs that
I hand out (Ubuntu will even <a href="http://www.shipit.ubuntulinux.org/">send
you several for free</a> if you like), and profess the quality of the software to
anyone who&#39;ll listen.</p>

<p>Trouble is, I&#39;ve hit a snag.  No, not the Java and Flash problem 
mentioned above, not the fact that OpenBSD seems to be much less user-friendly
than most Linux distributions (which I, in fact, disagree with), and certainly
not having to explain the joy of open source now that <a 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> and <a 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird">Thunderbird</a> have reached
1.0.  No, the problem is actually in the <em>business</em> of open source.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been an OpenBSD advocate for a few months now, and even decided to
abandon <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">my own Linux distribution</a>
due to OpenBSD&#39;s quality.  When 3.6 was released around November 1, I
chose to buy a CD set from the OpenBSD store.  $45 was nothing compared to the
immeasurable amount I&#39;d shelled out for software over the years, and I
even threw in a $5 donation.  It also helped that I wasn&#39;t being 
<em>required</em> to pay for this software, but could even download it for
free, had I chosen.  I have a high-speed connection, I&#39;d already made a 
script to do that quite easily, so you can&#39;t even really say it added to
convenience.  I was actually just giving money for the nice warm feeling, and
for some free stickers.</p>

<p>Trouble was, the stickers were pretty poor, the CD case was broken to the 
point that it couldn&#39;t securely hold the CDs, and the whole package arrived
about a month later than I expected it to.  No big deal&mdash;as I said, I
almost considered this money a donation&mdash;but poor practice.  Even for
those in the communal mindset, it&#39;s hard to get away from thinking you 
should be getting a <em>product</em> when you <em>pay</em> for one.</p>

<p>Even worse has been my interactions with the <a
href="http://www.mozillastore.com">Mozilla Store</a>.  When Firefox 1.0 was
about to be released, I shelled out a few bucks to be listed as a friend in
a New York Times ad set to run within three weeks of the launch.  That 
date&#39;s come and gone, and <a 
href="http://news.com.com/Firefoxs+Times+ad+late+as+10+million+downloads+near/2100-1032_3-5481998.html">the ad is yet to happen</a>.  At the same time, I
decided to purchase some <a 
href="http://www.mozillastore.com/products/stuff/firefoxstickers">Firefox
stickers</a> from the Mozilla store.  As it happens, I&#39;m about an hour
away from their shipping house.  They were shipped on October 26th, 
&ldquo;reshipped&rdquo; twice according to email and phone conversations, and
I finally had to give up and ask for a refund yesterday.  (I&#39;m still 
waiting for that refund to actually be posted to my bank account.)</p>

<p>No business would survive in the marketplace like this;  this happens 
because nobody expects open-source software developers to know anything about
business.  Indeed, there&#39;s no reason why they should.  On the other hand,
the developers want to&mdash;they want to sell stickers and raise money in 
other ways, since they&#39;re not raising any by selling software.  It just
doesn&#39;t work.  At best, they outsource the product, get a nominal share of
the profit, and the consumer gets a decent buy.  At worst&hellip; well, I&#39;m
sure there are stories worse than mine.</p>

<p>So, sad as it is, I&#39;ll go back to not paying for software or for
software-related things.  I won&#39;t pay for advocacy, though I&#39;ll try to
make the occasional donation.  I suppose as long as I know up front that 
it&#39;s just a donation, it <em>may</em> feel like I&#39;ve gotten my
money&#39;s worth.</p>

<h2>I&#39;m back!</h2>

<p>Actually, I&#39;ve been back in LA for more than 48 hours, but recovering
for most of that.  Saturday (the hardest day for my committee) went fairly
well, with only minor indigestion.  At the moment, I&#39;m trying to get
caught up on other work, as well as trying to get an early start on studying
for the endocrine system exam.  As usual, not terribly worried about it, but
it would be nice to study at a slightly less hectic schedule than usual.</p>

<p>The semester&#39;s winding down quite nicely.  Only three or four more
school-related tasks, mostly eclipsed by that last exam of the calendar year.
I&#39;ve also got one more ICM workshop (domestic violence, tomorrow), and my
semiannual ICM evaluation (on Thursday).  I can&#39;t imagine those being
terribly bad.  (Well, I can <em>imagine</em> it, but really don&#39;t think
it&#39;ll happen.)  After those, the exam next Friday (two days after my 
birthday), and then off for just a few days before leaving for Xmas in 
Colorado with Lindsey&#39;s mom and stepdad.</p>

<p>So, all in all, a little hectic&mdash;but it shouldn&#39;t be too bad as
long as I stay healthy.  Cross your fingers.</p>

<p>I do actually have a few things I want to mention, but I&#39;ll save them
for next time.</p>

<h2>AMA Meeting</h2>

<p>So I&#39;m in Atlanta at the AMA-MSS Interim Meeting this weekend (well, 
until Saturday, anyway).  I can&#39;t say it&#39;s particularly enjoyable, I 
can&#39;t say were getting particularly good work done, but at least it looks
good on the old CV and I officially don&#39;t have to go to school for a
couple of days.</p>

<h2>Cheating and community&hellip;</h2>

<p>We had a little meeting today at <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/">Keck</a> that&#39;s been coming for
a little while.  Turns out on our respiratory system exam a few weeks ago, 
someone allegedly was copying answers off a classmate&#39;s exam, and it&#39;s
sparked a fairly heated discussion about what should be done in such 
situations.  There doesn&#39;t seem to be an obvious consensus, and I&#39;m not
perfectly sure where I stand on the issue either.</p>

<p>The first opinion to be expressed (when the claim was reported to the class
via email) was that the cheater is only hurting himself.  In fact, the
respondent made the point that he&#39;d cheated, though not since undergrad, 
and &ldquo;grew up&rdquo; after coming to the realization that it wasn&#39;t
helping in the long run.  The next opinion, which was delivered by a friend
who was held to task quite a bit for it, was that it was a probelm of patient
care, and that, essentially, any cheater would end up having lawsuits up the
hoo-hah.</p>

<p>Today saw discussion of the honor code, the problems with additional
proctoring and more, but the overall message was that students (and, later,
physicians) need to &ldquo;grow out&rdquo; of the playground attitude that
&ldquo;tattling is bad&rdquo;.  It&#39;s proper, professional, and required to
confront colleagues you believe to be behaving unprofessionally, and to report
such to appropriate authorities if you&#39;re not satisfied with the
confrontation.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where a bit of conundrum starts for me.  I don&#39;t cheat (in
my opinion), and don&#39;t know anyone who does (again, in my opinion).  (Why
the &ldquo;opinions&rdquo;?  Because I share answers.  Not on exams, and not
on anything I&#39;ve been specifically told not to collaborate on.  Information,
however, wants to be free&mdash;and others disagree with that.  We&#39;ll
therefore, for the moment, consider cheating to be the disobeying of expressed 
rules, and avoid the &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; terminology.)  Problem is, helping
one another along as students and physicians has been taught to us as an
inherent part of the health care community, and it is certainly my belief that
sharing the load is appropriate and professional.  We were asked today, 
&ldquo;If you decide not to report cheating, where do you draw the line?&rdquo;
I have no good answer, and I&#39;m not suggesting we <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be
reporting cheating, I just don&#39;t know that we <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>Everyone seems to accept that cheating is going to happen, despite 
encouragement to adhere to the honor code or increasing security at exams.  If
that&#39;s actually the case, then my suggestion is to have a formal or 
informal session discouraging students from cheating, and leave it at that.
If there is something to be done to actually <em>end</em> cheating, consider
whether it will also impinge on the open community attitude we&#39;re supposed
to be fostering before implementing it.</p>

<p>It seems that we&#39;re continually more willing to give up rights than to
simply expect more of one another.  Maybe people as a whole deserve that
attitude.  I&#39;m somehow both cynical and idealistic, so I can&#39;t make
that decision myself.  In the meantime, though, I&#39;ll try to at least retain
my rights.</p>

<h2>Back to work&hellip;</h2>

<p>Time, once again, to get off my lazy butt and get some work done.  The
<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12855.html">AMA-MSS Interim
Meeting</a> is less than a week away, and I still have a decent amount of
preparatory work to do (not to mention packing and making sure all my
electronics equipment is set to go).  It&#39;s been a nice little Thanksgiving
break, though&mdash;even if I have eaten way too much.  With the AMA meeting
this week, the endocrine system exam only a couple weeks after that, and a real
need to start preparing for USMLE step 1 (which I&#39;ll take next June), 
it seems like work will really start to gear up.  I&#39;m sure it will all be
fine&mdash;as long as I can pull myself away from my several hobbies that in
no way advance my professional life.</p>

<p>No good shopping yesterday after all.  Turns out we got to <a
href="http://www.frys.com">Fry&#39;s</a> after just about all the sale items I 
was looking at were sold out.  There were a couple of decent rebate deals I 
still could have picked up, but by that point I just didn&#39;t want to stand
in line for them.  Ah, well.</p>

<p>No movies this weekend, either.  Well, none in theaters, anyway.  Lindsey 
and I watched a couple of <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> DVDs
that have been sitting around a couple of weeks.  <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363589/">Elephant</a>, by <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/">Good Will Hunting</a> director
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001814/">Gus Van Sant</a> is a depressing,
boring, and just incredibly <em>slow</em> look at high school violence.  I
know I&#39;m supposed to be a movie geek, but it really is just a proclivity
for <em>movies</em>, not <em>films</em>.  The last several &ldquo;films&rdquo;
I&#39;ve seen have been incredibly boring.  One star.</p>

<p>And, just to prove that my tastes aren&#39;t in the high-brow indie flick
area, we also watched the 80&#39;s <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131/">John Cusack</a> classic <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088794/">Better Off Dead&hellip;</a>.  Odd,
but quite entertaining.  Almost an 80&#39;s movie that makes fun of itself.
Good stuff.  Three stars (well, barely).  Don&#39;t bother unless you, like
me, are a fan of both 80&#39;s teen comedies and John Cusack.</p>

<h2>Happy Thanksgiving!</h2>

<p>Well, I&#39;m finally recovering from the coma-like state induced by one of
the <em>best</em> turkeys I&#39;ve ever eaten.  I don&#39;t know exactly what
it is, but Lindsey makes turkey and stuffing better than anyone else I&#39;ve
ever known.  Sure, I have simple tastes;  none of that weird stuff like grapes
or raisins or apples in the stuffing, no &ldquo;turducken&rdquo; or 
deep-frying, just amazingly good old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner.  For the
others of you who celebrate today with ridiculous amounts of food and doing
absolutely nothing productive, I hope you&#39;ve had a good one!</p>

<p>And, as tradition and economic conditions dictate, we&#39;ll be going
shopping tomorrow.  Sure, some might (and do) consider it insane to go out on
the busiest shopping day of the year, but it&#39;s also the one with the best
deals, and I&#39;m a sucker for a good deal.  That mean&#39;s I&#39;ll be
hitting <a href="http://www.frys.com">Fry&#39;s</a> early and trying to pick
up cheap electronics I don&#39;t need.  We&#39;ll grab some food, and finish
with probably some typical suburban mall shopping.  Unlikely to see any
movies this weekend, as <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346491/">Alexander</a> is getting <a
href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alexander/">phenomenally bad reviews</a>.
Still waiting for the Oscar movie of the year&hellip;.</p>

<p>Just finished watching the eighth season of <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/">Friends</a>.  Still amazing to me
that some of the sitcoms from the last ten years have such replay power that
I&#39;ll shell out forty bucks every six months to keep a season for 
posterity&mdash;despite the fact I&#39;ve seen most episodes more times than I
can count in syndication.  I&#39;m not planning to buy all the seasons of <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/">Seinfeld</a>, but you can bet 
I&#39;ll be renting them from <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and I gotta mention that I finally got copies of Don Knuth&#39;s <a
href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">The Art of
Computer Programming</a>.  Lindsey gave it to me (early) for my birthday.
(I believe I&#39;ve mentioned before that she&#39;s the best significant other
ever.)  Some might find it odd that I still wanted the books after leaving
math.  Hey, I may be doing medicine, but I&#39;m still a geek (maybe more than
ever), and I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say <em>no</em> geek should be
without these texts.  I honestly plan to read them cover-to-cover.  I just
have no idea when.</p>

<h2>Good Morning!</h2>

<p>Well, I&#39;m up early and in a linking mood.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t normally talk much about hot-button issues, and I&#39;m going
to continue that by simply linking to someone else who&#39;s talking about
one and then talking about their article.  Anna Quindlen of MSNBC has <a
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6542344/site/newsweek/">a really impressive
writeup</a> of some current issues surrounding abortion and women&#39;s rights.
The remarkable part is that it&#39;s a <em>real</em> plea for reasonabilty, for
discussing issues and acknowledging differences, as opposed to trotting out
slogans and telling everyone how ignorant or insensitive they are.  Not 
bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com">MSNBC</a> is also the home of my newest
regular read, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6210240/">Bloggermann</a>
by Keith Olbermann.  While most networks are desperately fighting for their 
legitimacy by denouncing blogs as the antithesis of journalism, Olbermann and
MSNBC have decided to embrace the format.  Purists will note that his page is
essentially updated daily, isn&#39;t in a stream-of-consciousness format, is
funny, insightful, and well-written, and therefore probably bears more 
resemblance to a newspaper column than a blog&mdash;but it&#39;s 
<em>called</em> Bloggermann, so who am I to argue?  His observations on the
Ohio recount were about the only coverage I saw in the &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;
media, and were very well done.  Have a read sometime.</p>

<h2>Woo Hoo! Thanksgiving Break!</h2>

<p>Thanks to some nice planning by one of my classmates and the acquiescence
of the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/">Keck</a> faculty, our
Thanksgiving break officially started at 3 PM today.  Of course, I was home by
1:45 and probably wouldn&#39;t have attended tomorrow even if there were 
classes, but somehow it&#39;s always nice for the slacker philosophy to be
proven the appropriate one.</p>

<p>Speaking of slacking, I&#39;ve been doing plenty&mdash;yet somehow also 
getting plenty of work done.  This was our second week of the Endocrine system,
so it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve started studying yet, but there&#39;s plenty to
do outside academia, too.  I&#39;ve finished most of the superstructure of my
<a href="http://www.christianjones.md">new professional site</a>;  although 
it&#39;s not yet automated, has much larger images to download than I&#39;d
like, and contains little if any content as of yet, I&#39;m pretty proud of it.
I&#39;ll end up posting there information about events I&#39;ll be attending
(such as the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12855.html">AMA
meeting in Atlanta</a> next weekend), thoughts on health care, and so forth.
Don&#39;t worry;  my more glib (or rather, less professional) thoughts will
still all be posted here instead&mdash;it&#39;s unlikely the new site will
be of interest to anyone outside health care.  Of course, it&#39;s unlikely
either will be of interest to anyone at all.</p>

<p>Also been doing quite a bit of <a href="/~chjones/music/acappella">arranging</a> for
Chorda Tympani, our a cappella group.  At the moment (unfortunately), it&#39;s
all Xmas music&mdash;the tradition has been to do carolling for the first 
semester, and &ldquo;real&rdquo; a cappella for the second.  Expect some
good stuff in January or February.  I don&#39;t want to mention specifics just
yet, mostly because I don&#39;t know what my mad skillz will allow me to
concoct.</p>

<p>Finally, on the personal health front, my ultrasound last week was fine;
no enlarged liver, gallstones, or ulcers.  Some mild splenomegaly we&#39;ll
check out with a CBC, and my nausea and stomach pains have actually been 
getting a bit better (I think).  How much has to do with not going to school,
with the fact that I&#39;ve had no coffee since November 12, and how much is
entirely unexplained, I have no idea.  Oh yeah, no coffee&mdash;and my entire
caffeine consumption has dropped to about the equivalent of 4-5 cans of diet
soda over the last two weeks, and is still dropping.  I&#39;m sleeping
somewhat better, and generally feel a <em>little</em> less stressed.  Best
advice I can give anyone else used to a pot of coffee a day:  stop.</p>

<p>And speaking of sleeping better, time to go do that.  More later!</p>

<h2>Done with Respiratory!</h2>

<p>Okay, so I passed respiratory and it&#39;s on to endocrine.  I can&#39;t
say I&#39;m looking forward to it all that much, despite my family&#39;s
history of diabetes mellitus.  Besides, my last hemoglobin A1C was 5.0, so
nothing to worry about at the moment, anyway.  Oh, but I digress&mdash;my
main point was that the respiratory system (certainly the worst-taught one at
<a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/">Keck</a> so far) is over and
it&#39;s back to doing things that have as little to do with medicine as
possible.</p>

<p>Of course, at the moment that&#39;s not particularly little.  I&#39;ve got
to work on my Required Student Project, the <a
href="http://medcenter.usc.edu">MedCenter web site</a>, and get ready for
the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12855.html">AMA-MSS
Interim Meeting</a> the first weekend of December in Atlanta.  As chair of
the logistics committee, there&#39;se not a ton of stuff I have to do before
the conference starts, but as a member of the Computers and Technology
Committee I have a report or two to finish writing.  Throw in the work I&#39;m
doing on improving my <a href="http://www.christianjones.md">professional 
site</a>, and it seems that more and more of my &ldquo;free time&rdquo; work
is medically related, at least tangentially.</p>

<p>Been starting to have some stomach problems, too, which I&#39;m fairly
comfortable for the moment writing up to stress&mdash;but <em>what</em>
stress?  Sure, I study during exam weeks, but I certainly don&#39;t stress
about school the way most of my colleagues do.  I let other things get to me,
like getting easily annoyed by my neighbors, but don&#39;t really consider
myself a stressed person.  Took a proton pump inhibitor (<a 
href="http://www.prevacid.com">Prevacid</a>), which didn&#39;t really seem to
work, but <a href="http://www.prilosecotc.com">Prilosec</a> seems to be doing
a bit better.  I&#39;ll get an ultrasound tomorrow (which isn&#39;t likely to
show more than a fatty liver), and take it from there.  Of course, we&#39;re
just assuming it&#39;s an ulcer at this point, but I&#39;m not anemic&mdash;I
think the worst outcome I fear at this point is having to cut back on spicy
foods.  I&#39;ve already reduced my regular caffeine intake by 75%;  at this
point, I might just stop drinking it and see if my sleep improves too.</p>

<p>Oh, and of course god forbid I should go on a diet&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Happy Firefox Launch!</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> 1.0
is released today!  This is the web browser I use, even on Windows, and is far
and above the best available.  It includes tabbed browsing, popup blocking,
a cool, fast interface, and is, of course, free software.  Since the official
sites are getting hammerred now that the news is out, I&#39;ve decided to post
a copy of the Windows installer on
this site.  Have fun!</p>

<p>[Edit:  As of the evening of the launch, <a

<h2><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/">The Incredibles</a></h2>

<p>are pretty darned entertaining.  Good stuff all around&mdash;and the action
was just as good as any modern live-action, special-effects-laden superhero
movie.  Lots of little tiny homages, as expected from any <a

movies.  Easily as good as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/">Toy

Honestly, the only real drawback was the huge crowds of kids and other people
who clearly don&#39;t get out often.  Thus, I&#39;ll leave this one with
three stars, a recommendation that it&#39;s worth paying to see, and the advice
to go early in the day or after it&#39;s been out two or three weeks.  
Don&#39;t worry&mdash;this one isn&#39;t leaving the theatres any time 
soon.</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely to be a few days before I&#39;m updating regularly here
again.  My respiratory system exam is six days away, and this one is likely to
take quite a bit of cramming.  If I get sick of it and feel like doing anything
other than sitting in front of the TV for an hour or two, I&#39;ll write a bit
more.  Until then&hellip;</p>

<h2>Non-election stuff</h2>

<p>So, I&#39;ve still got some time before hearing Kerry&#39;s concession
speech, and despite my interest in the elections, there are actually a couple
of other things I wanted to mention.  As usual, they have to do with movies
and TV.</p>

<p>It&#39;s looking like <a 
href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/11/03/news/fortune500/nbc_pride/">NBC will be
cancelling Father of the Pride</a>.  Oh, it&#39;s no superb show, but it was
a decent laugh before <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/">Scrubs</a>
on Tuesday nights.  As usual, my guess is that most of the jokes were a little
too &ldquo;adult&rdquo;, but there were a few annoying parts. (Come on, why 
would animated Sigfried and Roy be better than their live action counterparts?)
If anything, this and the tragic downturn of <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a> will just cause
me to cut out about a third of my <a 
href="http://www.nbc.com">NBC</a> viewing.</p>

<p>I keep hearing good buzz about <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/">The Incredibles</a>, opening this
weekend.  Lindsey and I will probably head out to see that, but I&#39;m not
sure exactly when.  Hey, I&#39;d just as much love to see <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/">National Treasure</a> (which is
quite likely to be crap), but there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll drag her to that.</p>

<h2>Nothing to see here&hellip;</h2>

<p>So, after an extremely active (for me) writing day yesterday, I&#39;d like
to keep up the pace, but have to study for a respiratory quiz this afternoon.
Still, there are still enough thoughts bouncing around in my aching head for
an update or two.</p>

<p>When I awoke with Lindsey at 6 this morning, there was still far from any
definitive answer to who won the presidential election.  <a 
href="http://www.msnbc.com">MSNBC</a> still had Bush at 269 electoral votes,
having failed to award any of the remaining states to him.  <a
href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> still hadn&#39;t called Ohio, leaving 
Bush at 259, and Kerry a few points behind.  She went to work, I went back
to sleep.</p>

<p>Kerry apparently decided to do the menschy thing and concede the election.
This was actually what I&#39;d hoped Gore would do in 2000, concede to 
&ldquo;spare the nation&#39;s humility&rdquo; and run again.  Now, it&#39;s
unlikely Kerry will run again, and there may be better things worth sparing at
this point than the nation&#39;s humility, but I still get the point, and still
applaud the gesture.  He&#39;ll be giving his official concession speech in a
few minutes, so I&#39;ll keep this short.</p>

<p>More later?</p>

<h2>Oh, it could still happen&hellip;</h2>

<p>And, once more addressing the bitching I loathe, there could be plenty 
more.</p>

<p>There will certainly be some returns coming in over the next few days that
could change things, but won&#39;t necessarily.  I&#39;m about to go to bed
with the race (according to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com">MSNBC</a>) still at
269 to 207, with Bush in the lead.  At the moment, he also has the lead in
Nevada and New Mexico, as well as in Iowa, a state which <a
href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> seems to think won&#39;t be able to decide
on a winner until the end of the week.</p>

<p>Again, the idea is that if Bush wins any of these (or the other 
still-not-called states of Minnesota, Wisconson, Michigan, or Hawaii), 
it&#39;ll be over.  That&#39;s apparently just not happenning yet, and 
I&#39;m going to bed.  (Actually, that&#39;s the best argument I have for
electronic voting&mdash;getting all the results before I&#39;m too tired to
pay attention.)</p>

<p>Oh, and about the ceasely bitching I ceaselessly bitch about:  I&#39;m
still fairly certain I&#39;d rather have a whiny nation than a police state.
Pretty sure.  Probably.  I think.</p>

<h2>So, this is mildly interesting&hellip;</h2>

<p>Is it possible?  (Well, obviously the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; as 
I&#39;m writing, but&hellip;)  <a href="http://www.msnbc.com">MSNBC</a> has
already called both Florida and Ohio for Bush, giving him an electoral vote of
269;  <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> has been a bit more conservative
in &ldquo;calling&rdquo; states throughout the evening, but hasn&#39;t yet
actually disagreed on a result.  (We&#39;ll see later if this, er, 
&ldquo;strategy&rdquo; actually works out for CNN.)  If Bush wins another
state (and assuming MSNBC&#39;s projections are correct), he&#39;s got the
Presidency again.  But just the fact that he stands at that magic number, one
shy of the electoral votes needed to win, brings up the conspiracy-theorist
dream, the rumored idea that&#39;s been circling the net pundits for the last
few days&mdash;an electoral tie.</p>

<p>Oh, even in such a case, there are still some interesting possibilities.  An
elector may choose to switch votes, in which case others may do the same.  This
seems fairly unlikely, but so did a tie a few hours ago.  If they all vote the
way they&#39;re &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to, then the <a 
href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> basically chooses.
The bad news, even compared to my preferred candidate not winning in one way or
another, is that either of these scenarios leads to four years of bitching
&ldquo;unfair&rdquo; and &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; and &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; by the
losing party.  That really doesn&#39;t help in any way.  Plenty of my friends
and colleagues already feel that way about the 2000 election;  why would it be
better this time around?  This isn&#39;t a party issue, at this 
point&mdash;I&#39;m fairly certain that both Republicans and Democrats are
excellent whiners, and that they both annoy people just as much when they do
so.</p>

<p>I hope it doesn&#39;t happen.  If it does, I hope people will see that 
it&#39;s because of the system we have, and perhaps even make efforts to change
that system.  Claiming they were disenfranchised (that&#39;s the proper word
for &ldquo;cheated&rdquo;) won&#39;t change anything.</p>

<p>About the only thing I&#39;m becoming aware of at this point (aside from my
usual fatigue) is that, as I&#39;d half-joked to friends yesterday, we 
won&#39;t really know anything for another month, anyway.</p>

<h2>It&#39;s official</h2>

<p>No, no official <em>results</em> in the election yet&mdash;it&#39;s just
official that I&#39;m again, at least temporarily, a news junkie.  I&#39;m
sitting at my computer with eight <a 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> tabs open to 
various pages on <a href="http://www.msnbc.com">MSNBC</a>, <a 
href="http://www.slate.com">Slate</a>, and <a

a couple for <a href="https://gmail.google.com">Gmail</a> and <a
href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.  At this point, all I&#39;ve really
learned is that I wish there were a way to tell a tab to &ldquo;refresh&rdquo;
every n minutes.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the <a 
href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> has been <a
href="http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2004_11.php#002062">monitoring e-voting
problems</a> nationwide.  (This, unfortunately, only partially offsets my
quite <em>un</em>pleasant surprise that as many as a third of American voters
are using the ATM-like touchscreens.  It doesn&#39;t bode well that I&#39;ve
<em>personally</em> heard people having trouble with the machines.)  Hey, 
I&#39;m a technophile, but the way these machines are made and used frightens
me like no blinking &ldquo;12:00&rdquo; ever could.  Shamelessly stolen from 
the <a href="http://www.eff.org/e-vote/">EFF&#39;s &ldquo;Verify the 
Vote&rdquo;</a> site, I think this pretty much sums it up:

<h2>Happy Election Day!</h2>

<p>Ah, election day.  How could it <em>not</em> be fun to sit around for hours
(especially since my vote was cast last week) and wait to discover the fate of
the world?  Lindsey&#39;s off taking her actuarial test at the moment, I&#39;ve
already watched an episode of <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a> (which 
essentially just disappointed me in the quality of our real-world leaders), and
I&#39;m about to start tidying the house for the hard-core partying to come.
(NB:  I suppose, to be fair, hard-core partying doesn&#39;t really necessitate
any prior tidying, but is there anything wrong with making it look nice?)</p>

<p>Oh, I suppose I should mention that in a mark of true marketing genius (or
at least marketing consciousness), the third season of The West Wing is also
released on DVD today.  Seriously, I never would have thought of that.  But,
hey, if you want to really make my election day, regardless of Presidential
victor, head over to <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and buy it 
for me (or, really, anything else on my Wish List would be fine).  Really.
Buy me stuff.</p>

<h2>Happy Day of the Dead!</h2>

<p>For the second year in a row, we didn&#39;t get a single trick-or-treater
at our house for Halloween.  Just more candy for us, sure, but I&#39;m feeling
a little ill after making a meal from snack-size Snickers bars and 
Hershey&#39;s miniatures.  At this point, if I don&#39;t have crazy 
sugar-induced nightmares (or go into a diabetic coma), I think I&#39;ll
actually be surprised.</p>

<p>In further preparation and relaxation for Lindsey&#39;s actuarial exam
tomorrow, we went out for our typical dinner and a movie.  Unfortunately,
there doesn&#39;t really seem to be much out worth seeing, so we settled on
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252028/">Surviving Christmas</a>, the
latest <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/">Ben Affleck</a> fare.  To
be kind, I&#39;ll call it two stars, but really only because I did actually
chuckle a time or two.  On the other hand, there were plenty of times I was
just writhing in my chair, so call it as you will.  Not really good enough for
a rental, but still good enough to be a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; movie for the sake
of getting out of the house.</p>

<p>Our first Health Care for All meeting went off without any serious glitches,
though it was competing with a couple of other organizations.  Since one was
Chorda Tympani, with which I&#39;m also involved, there was some bouncing back
and forth.  On the other hand, the a cappella group is just doing some 
Christmas carolling this semester, and I won&#39;t be around for the biggest
concert, so I&#39;ll be taking a fairly minor role in that for the moment.
Next semester, though, we&#39;ll hopefully be able to do some interesting
stuff.</p>

<p>So, for now, it&#39;s off to bed.  Wish Lindsey luck (though I think 
she&#39;s quite well prepared), and I&#39;ll keep writing soon.</p>

<h2>Happy Halloween!</h2>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t have a significant announcement of any kind, so
I thought I&#39;d just try to babble about for a while.</p>

<p>Lindsey&#39;s third actuarial exam is coming up on Tuesday, a day bound to
be the start of some non-actuarial significance.  (Actually, I suppose it
wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if some statisticians were called in to count
votes in certain states.)  She&#39;s a little stressed, but doing quite
well.  At least she gets tomorrow and Tuesday off work.  We&#39;ll try to catch
a movie and some early dinner to relax tomorrow.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s only after tons of school stuff I have tomorrow.  No,
not class (who&#39;d you think was writing this?), but rather the first meeting
of &ldquo;Health Care for All&rdquo;, the single-payer health plan advocacy
club on campus, of which I&#39;m the treasurer. (They don&#39;t actually seem to
care that I&#39;m not actually a supporter of the single-payer plan.)  As the
treasurer, I apparently am the one who orders pizza and fills out the
reimbursement forms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that first meeting coincides with that of Chorda Tympani, the
med school a cappella group, another group I&#39;m supposed to be leading.  In
this case, though, I&#39;ve essentially handed the group over to another 
student until January, since the first semester is basically just Christmas
carols and such.  With any luck, we&#39;ll be able to do some real 
East Coast-style a cappella in the spring, and I&#39;ll have a bit more input
into that.</p>

<p>As far as computing goes, I&#39;ve had to put <a 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp">Windows XP</a> back onto my laptop, 
since it&#39;ll pretty much be required for the AMA conference I&#39;m
attending in December.  I&#39;m the chair of the Logistics and Resources
committee for that conference;  we&#39;re kind of the A-V club, and I have to
be able to interact more compatibly than <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> might let me.  The good news is that
I&#39;ve actually now realized it&#39;s <em>harder</em> to install and update
Windows than to do the same for OpenBSD or <a 
href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a>.  There&#39;s just so much
useless confirmation clicking it seems to take forever.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also started to experiment a little with Linux again, in the hopes
of making my January 1, 2005 deadline for removing all closed-source software
from all my machines.  At this point, just for ease of setup of our main
desktop, I&#39;m looking at the apparent ease-of-use of <a 
href="http://www.mepis.org">SimplyMEPIS</a> or the cleanliness (and
Slackware base) of <a href="http://www.vectorlinux.com">VectorLinux</a>.
Over the next few weeks, I&#39;ll be trying them both out;  I&#39;ll let you
know any interesting findings.  (Okay, I&#39;ll be honest&mdash;I&#39;ll
probably either never mention them again or I&#39;ll let you know definitively
uninteresting stuff.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m liking OpenBSD more and more from a design standpoint&mdash;it&#39;s
definitely the kind of thing I would have done myself given the skills and the
time, and I&#39;m more and more glad I abandoned the <a 
href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux</a> project.  I&#39;ve 
migrated all my PCs except the main desktop system (and my laptop, as I 
mentioned above) to running only OpenBSD, and have even (finally) put all my
seven hundred something gigabyte media fileserver all into OpenBSD format, and
discovered some interesting large file bugs in the process.  Could this be my
entrance into OpenBSD development?  Only time will tell&mdash;time I already
have committed to other things, I&#39;m sure.</p>

<h2>Medical Care Outsourcing?</h2>

<p>Just noticed <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/22/2051244">a
Slashdot article</a> (which is referencing <a 
href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6293825/">an MSNBC/Washington Post 
article</a>) with the ominous title &ldquo;Medical Care Gets Outsourced 
Too&rdquo;.  It essentially deals with a guy who needed a cardiac valve 
replacement (not that uncommon) and found that he could do have it done for 
about one twentieth of the cost in India.  This (and similar cases) have been
going on a long time, from surgery to prescription filling.  No, this is in no 
way news, or at least wouldn&#39;t be if both health care and job loss 
weren&#39;t centers of the political universe at the moment.</p>

<p>Trouble is, the way this article is presented (the Slashdot lead, not the 
Washington Post article) focuses on outsourcing.  Yeah, outsourcing is a big 
concern, especially in the tech group that <a 
href="http://www.slashdot.com">Slashdot</a> caters to.  (Well, okay, I read it,
too, but may not be the official target demographic.)  What this does, though, 
is try to make it everyone&#39;s concern, with the hope that some influential 
MD will say &ldquo;I&#39;m going to lose my job to India!  Stop 
outsourcing!&rdquo;, and ridiculous tariffs (or something) will follow.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a job loss issue.  This is a health care issue.  I believe
the claim that the care this patient received was as good as he&#39;d have
gotten just about anywhere, and I&#39;m not scared that people will go to other
countries and receive substandard or dangerous care.  I&#39;m afraid
they&#39;ll <em>have</em> to go to other countries to get any care at all.
Care in <em>this</em> country is quickly becoming substandard.  Add to that the
health insurance problem:  the patient in the article was quoted a US$200,000
surgery after a $50,000 deposit, mainly because he didn&#39;t have insurance.
He instead chose to spend $10,000 to go to India and have the operation.
I&#39;ve met other patients in similar situations, breaking the bank to pay
cash for an uninsured hospital stay.  They&#39;re the new ranks of the
&ldquo;wealthy uninsured&rdquo;, who aren&#39;t rich, but could certainly
afford insurance if they chose to.</p>

<p>What about those that can&#39;t?  What about someone who couldn&#39;t
scrape together $10,000?  There&#39;s some line under which you can&#39;t get
medical care anywhere, yet is still higher than the limit for getting
Medicaid (or the equivalent).  I&#39;m not suggesting a single-payer plan
is the answer (the article actually mentions Brits and Canadians going to
India to avoid long waits), but our current system certainly isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>End today&#39;s rant.</p>

<h2>Boons and banes</h2>

<p>Ah, the trials of being a computer enthusiast on a medical student&#39;s
budget.  I made a promise to myself a little while back that I wouldn&#39;t
buy another hard drive until I could get it for less than US$0.50 per gigabyte
without a rebate, and (without promising) set a goal of getting four 250 gig
drives and setting up a nice RAID for my next purchase.  Well, it turns out
that <a href="http://www.frys.com">Fry&#39;s</a> has just what I wanted now,
and has them for $119.99.  (<a 
href="http://www.frys-electronics-ads.com">frys-electronics-ads.com</a> 
hasn&#39;t updated their page yet, but the Southern California ad also appears
in the olde tyme print newspaper.)  Trouble is, I don&#39;t really have an
extra five hundred twenty dollars to spend.  Oh, the pains of my life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I probably <em>should</em> be studying instead of driving
out to Fry&#39;s, anyway.  Oh, I&#39;m sure I still won&#39;t, but I 
<em>should</em> be.  Lindsey&#39;s working hard for the last couple of weeks
before her third actuarial exam (which happens to be on election day), and 
so we have a couple of &ldquo;no fun&rdquo; weekends planned.  I&#39;ll
probably just spend some time at <a href="http://www.borders.com">Borders</a>
in Pasadena, screw around with computer stuff, and hopefully get some 
modicum of work done.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and praise my friend Janet&#39;s name for finally getting me a
<a href="http://gmail.google.com">Gmail</a> account.  Loving it so far.  No,
I&#39;m not actively giving out the address since I plan to keep <a
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">chjones@aleph0.com</a> as my 
&ldquo;portable&rdquo; address and just forward it there.  Hey, I&#39;m just
amazed I&#39;ve already got 3 megs on there.</p>

<h2>I&#39;m back</h2>

<p>After a short hiatus for studying and such, I&#39;m back.  Lots of little
announcements, no real big ones.  Perhaps the biggest is my registration of <a
href="http://www.christianjones.md">christianjones.md</a>;  I was ecstatic to
see that it was actually available.  That&#39;ll turn into my 
&ldquo;professional&rdquo; site, while <a 
href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones">this</a> will remain my 
&ldquo;personal&rdquo;.  No, that doesn&#39;t mean that I plan to spend a
significant amount of time making the professional site all that great (for
instance, it hasn&#39;t been significantly updated from the simple welcome
page I posted).  Thus, it shouldn&#39;t take too much time away from this.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, I&#39;ve decided to start a simple example-only 
campaign to advertise public domain information on the web;  right now, I only
have the <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/NoRightsReserved/">No Rights 
Reserved</a> page at <a 
href="http://www.christianjones.md">christianjones.md</a> as a prototype.  
[Edit: as of 15 November, I&#39;ve started hosting it at <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com">aleph 0</a>.]  At
some point (in my copious free time), I&#39;ll make a simple explanatory and
usage page and post more details here.  For the moment, if you&#39;d like any
information about why this is necessary, please feel free to <a
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">email me</a>.</p>

<p>Went to <a href="http://www.frys.com">Fry&#39;s</a> and spent way too much
money again, but got some cool stuff, including yet another hard drive.  (I
mean seriously, 31 cents per gig?  How am I supposed to resist that?)  I
actually have a single machine (my &ldquo;media server&rdquo;) with over
800 gigabytes spread among six hard disks now, and well over a terabyte of
hard disk space distributed among my many desktops.</p>

<p>Finally finished watching the first season of <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/">&ldquo;Dead Like Me&rdquo;</a>;
I&#39;m gonna stick at a rating of three stars, with a recommendation to check
it out.  Certainly not for everybody, and I still like <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248654/">&ldquo;Six Feet Under&rdquo;</a>
better, but try watching the pilot if you have the time and inclination.</p>

<p>And, finaly, a bit of a disappointment with <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/">I Heart Huckabees</a>.  It was 
good, it was funny, and Lindsey liked it a lot&mdash;I think I was just hoping
for something more profound, or at least thought-provoking.  Still 
entertaining;  I&#39;d recommend it, if you&#39;re in the mood for a strange
laugh.  Personally, I&#39;m happy to say that the direction and the 
performances (especially those of <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163/">Dustin Hoffman</a> and <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005499/">Lily Tomlin</a>) were outstanding,
but think I liked <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/">Being
John Malkovich</a> (the closest to sharing a genre I can think of) as a more
lasting entertainer.  Three stars.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, and I passed renal.  Two down, six to go.  Just started 
respiratory yesterday;  I&#39;m still trying to decide whether I&#39;ll go
to most of the classes or not.  Prospective student interviews are starting, so
I have a bit of motivation for coming to school, but I&#39;m also biking again,
so I have bit of motivation not to.</p>

<h2>Debates</h2>

<p>Lots of debates.  Or, as I called them in my last post, 
&ldquo;debates&rdquo;, but somewhat noteworthy and entertaining nonetheless.
The most obvious, of course, was the first of the 2004 Presidential debates
last night.  Sure, Lindsey and I are only about one-third through the debate
itself (thanks, as usual, to <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a>), but
we watched the <a 
href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/indecision2004/">Indecision 
2004</a> coverage on <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com">Comedy
Central</a> last night after <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375355/">Joey</a> last night (which,
unfortunately, seems to be going downhill in a very bad way).  No real
comments about the debates themselves&mdash;suffice to say my expectations from
the other day were entirely justified.</p>

<p>Oh, but more debates&mdash;such as when to buy more hard drives.  Thanks
again to <a href="http://www.frys-electronics-ads.com">Fry&#39;s Ads</a> for
pointing out that hard drives have finally reached below $0.50/GB
<em>without</em> rebates.  Yeah, 160 GB <a 
href="http://www.maxtor.com">Maxtor</a>s for $69.99.  Oh, and I need more
space, too, despite recently noticing that I&#39;ve finally topped a terabyte
with all my home machines combined.  Unfortunately, Lindsey&#39;s studying
hard for actuarial exams, all my other friends and I are studying for the
renal exam next week, and my most recent financial aid disbursement check
hasn&#39;t arrived yet, all of which means this &ldquo;Limit 1 per 
customer&rdquo; deal won&#39;t yet satisfy my need for a 480 GB RAID-5 system.
Oh, well.  Debate&#39;s over, I guess.</p>

<p>And it looks unlikely we&#39;ll see <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/">I &hearts; Huckabees</a> this
weekend, too.  That&#39;s due mostly to our work schedule, but also to the
fact that it doesn&#39;t yet seem to be playing at the theaters we normally
frequent.  Only in limited release&mdash;guh.  Ah, more time for watching
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/">Dead Like Me</a>&mdash;er,
studying, I mean studying&hellip;.</p>

<div class="blog">

<h2>This&#39;ll be a short one&hellip;.</h2>

<p>Only a couple of quick notes, then it&#39;s back to the struggle between
studying renal and spending time implementing the organizational system from
<a href="http://www.davidco.com">Getting Things Done</a>;  you can guess
which is winning out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/">Scrubs</a> is still holding
its own well, funny as ever, despite the naysayers that it &ldquo;clearly
only has a few funny ideas left&rdquo;.  I&#39;m also not much of one for a 
show that regularly has a &ldquo;lesson&rdquo;, but it still keeps me laughing.
Surprisingly enough, <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361179/">Father of the Pride</a> is keeping
me going, too;  this was especially surprising since I didn&#39;t expect it
to last four episodes.  Of course, now that I&#39;ve shown early approval 
it&#39;s only a matter of time&hellip;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got disc three of the first season of <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/">Dead Like Me</a> ready to watch, 
but with the renal exam coming up next Friday (and with <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/">I &hearts; Huckabees</a> opening
this weekend), I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ll have a chance to watch it anytime
soon.</p>

<p>Finally, the two real reasons I wanted to make a post today.  First, it seems
that someone has finally demonstrated evidence of a theory most of us accept
readily (at least, most of us who drink a pot of coffee a day):  <a
href="http://www.scienceblog.com/community/article4209.html">caffeine
withdrawal is real</a>.  So real, it should even end up as a disorder in the
<a href="http://www.psych.org/research/dor/dsm/dsmintro81301.cfm">DSM-V</a> (in
2010).  As the most widely (ab)used behaviorally-active drug, that&#39;s 
not exactly surprising.</p>

<p>Finally, just because I know some people who&#39;ll be watching the 
Republican v. Democrat Presidential &ldquo;debate&rdquo; tomorrow night, I
wanted to point out <a href="http://www.advanceproj.com/connieon.asp">Connie
Rice</a>&#39;s <a 
href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4052162">Top 10
Secrets They Don&#39;t Want You to Know About the Debates</a>.  Oh, I may still
watch (though I&#39;m not sure why&mdash;I can&#39;t see changing my mind about
anything because of it), but just some good things to remember while
it&#39;s going on.  I guess I still think that one of these days, we&#39;ll
have a debate like in <a 
href="http://b4a.healthyinterest.net/ep/04_06.html">that episode of The West
Wing</a>.  Now <em>that</em>&#39;d be something.</p>

<h2>Movies &amp; TV</h2>

<p>That&#39;s just about all my free time anymore.  Tomorrow I&#39;ll again go
back to studying, spending as little time as possible in front of a computer
(i.e., no more than an hour per weekday) and trying to implement the 
organizational system from <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things
Done</a>.  In the meantime, plenty of movies and TV this weekend.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411011/">Medical
Investigation</a>.  It&#39;s going downhill.  Fast.  I&#39;m not ready to stop
watching the new show, but I&#39;m deleting all the episodes I&#39;ve saved off
the <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a>.  You gotta ask yourself, if 
it&#39;s not worth the disk space, is it worth watching again?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/">Dead Like Me</a>, on the
other hand, keeps getting better.  Lindsey and I are about halfway through the
first season, and I&#39;m still enjoying it, even if there are still plenty
of unanswered questions (hell, maybe <em>because</em> there are still plenty
of unanswered questions).</p>

<p>Okay, time for the weekend&#39;s movie reviews:</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356618/">The Forgotten</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Not bad for your standard <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/">X-Files</a>-esque psychological
&ldquo;thriller&rdquo;, but not that thrilling, either.  <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000194/">Julianne Moore</a> ably portrays
a woman whose physical reminders of her deceased son begin to disappear, but
she won&#39;t forget.  Blah, blah, blah, aliens probably did it.  Three stars
for the edge-of-your-seat factor, but no need to see it twice.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357054/">The Last Shot</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Seemed so promising, but left me without as many laughs as it promised.
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000111/">Matthew Broderick</a> is a
new Hollywood director, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000285/">Alec
Baldwin</a> is the producer who decides to make his film&mdash;except the 
producer is actually an FBI agent who&#39;s just faking the movie to sting
the mob, or the Teamsters, or somebody.  Seriously, if Matthew Broderick keeps
making movies like this and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327162/">The
Stepford Wives</a>, I&#39; going to have to write off any new movies he makes
and go back to watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/">Ferris
Bueller&#39;s Day Off</a> a few more times.  Two stars.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Oh, and don&#39;t forget that <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/">Star Wars</a> and its friends came
out on DVD this week, due in part to <a 
href="http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=572">George Lucas's piracy 
concerns</a>.  I&#39;m not really sure how this alleviates his concerns;  
I&#39;m sure, uh, plenty of people have already ripped the movies to a local
hard disk.</p>

<p>Peace out.  (I&#39;ve always wanted to say that, but it sounds as ridiculous
coming from me as does &ldquo;dang&rdquo; or &ldquo;baby&rdquo;.)  You keep
reading &#39;em, I&#39;ll keep watching &#39;em.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/">Dead Like Me</a></h2>

<p>So far, immensely entertaining.  Only four episodes (counting the pilot as
one) into it, so I&#39;ll again refrain from giving a quantitative rating, but
I will say for those of you with a <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>
account or disposable time or money, check it out.  Worth watching.</p>

<p>Also pleasantly surprised by this season&#39;s <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757/">ER</a> premiere.  Oh, it&#39;s
nothing like the show&#39;s first few seasons, but not as bad as I&#39;d
expected&mdash;of course, I&#39;d purposely tried not to get my hopes up.  I
am comfortable saying, though, that the inclusion of a car chase in an episode
most certainly means the show has <a 
href="http://www.jumptheshark.com/">jumped the shark</a>.  I&#39;m hoping the
same can&#39;t yet be said for <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a>.</p>

<p>Also finished watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119978/">The
Rainmaker</a> today.  Not bad, not great.  I suppose I was a little
disappointed considering the stars (<a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/">Matt Damon</a>, <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362/">Danny DeVito</a>, <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000132/">Claire Danes</a>, and more) and
the fact that it&#39;s a <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001300/">John Grisham</a> movie by <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338/">Francis Ford Coppola</a>.  Just
didn&#39;t live up to that promise, you know?  Three stars.  As usual, check
it out if that&#39;s your sort of thing.  I&#39;d personally substitute a
good episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844/">Law &amp;
Order</a>.</p>

<p>My wrist is slowly getting better, but I&#39;m spending the next several
days doing some pretty serious organizational stuff, so updates may still be
a little slow.  In the meantime, I&#39;ve also taken over administrative
responsibilities on <a href="http://medcenter.usc.edu">MedCenter</a>, the
USC med school student server, so please check it out and <a
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">email me</a> with any comments, especially
changes you&#39;d like to see.  For now, I&#39;ve finished another six pack of
<a href="http://www.newcastlebrown.com/">Newcastle</a>, so it&#39;s off to
bed.  Movies this weekend (hopefully).</p>

<h2>Pelvic exams</h2>

<p>We had our live-subject pelvic exam workshop last night.  Horrible.  Even
more uncomfortable than you might imagine, as our teacher (who was having us
perform the exam on her as she taught us) couldn&#39;t seem to find the 
balance between teaching (i.e., figurative hand-holding) and testing (i.e.,
bluntly saying &ldquo;no, you&#39;re doing it wrong).  In comparison to the
experiences of our classmates, I think my group&#39;s problem was that our
TA was much less laid back.  Made it that much more uncomfortable, 
y&#39;know?</p>

<p>Seriously, if I were ever given the choice of one thing in medicine I
never had to do again, this&#39;d be it.  Of course, the analog is probably
true for just about every woman who&#39;s ever had one performed on her, too.
Lord knows I&#39;ll scoff anytime I hear a man complain about a rectal from
now on.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.blockbuster.com">Blockbuster</a> online rentals</h2>

<p>A little different than <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>;  not
necessarily better or worse, but I&#39;ll stick with the company I know and
love (and still somehow consider the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo;).  Blockbuster
has essentially the same service (their return addresses even seem to be only
a few P.O. Boxes apart), with the addition of two free in-store rentals a month,
and is a couple bucks less.  Still, in the two week free trial period I&#39;m
just finishing, movies seem to take a bit longer to get shipped to me, and
I had to file a complaint (easy enough) to remind them I&#39;d already 
returned <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092718/">Can&#39;t Buy Me

<h2>XXX</h2>

<p>No, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295701/">the movie</a>, not
the rating.  Watched it this morning, and it was surprisingly good.  Really
just as cheesy and as entertaining as any Bond film.  Three stars.  Again,
definitely watch it if it&#39;s unedited and free.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286716/">Hulk</a> was another story.
Started off well enough, a solid three-star prospective, then took a dump on
itself with the absolutely terrible computer-animated muscleman.  Stopped
watching about five minutes after the green guy&#39;s first appearance; one
star.</p>

<p>And, the new surprise hit, the <a href="http://www.sho.com">Showtime</a>
original series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/">Dead Like Me</a>.
Saw the pilot tonight;  Lindsey and I will watch the remaining episodes of
season 1 over the next few weeks, and I&#39;ll have a brief review then.  So
far, so good.</p>

<p>Studying&#39;s also so far, so good.  If I can keep up the pace I&#39;m at
(and it&#39;s not that fast a pace), I&#39;ll be all set for the renal exam
in a couple of weeks, step 1 of the <a href="http://www.usmle.org">USMLE</a>
in June, and have learned medical Spanish proficiently by Christmas.  Now
taking all reasonable bets&hellip;</p>

<h2>For the first post in a while&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;just a quick update and a few movie reviews.  Got my splint off
today, so I&#39;m close to full speed typing again.  Also started working
regularly again (no, not employment, just actually doing schoolwork), and
working on extracurricular things more actively than just doing what comes
along.  Hey, if I can start dieting again, I&#39;ll be back where I need to
be.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend watching some <a 
href="http://www.blockbuster.com">Blockbuster</a> and <a
href="http://www.netflix.com">NetFlix</a> free rentals, as well as enjoying
the <a href="http://www.starz.com">Starz!</a> free preview weekend.  Oh,
mostly bad movies, but I can&#39;t complain about the, er, access to them on
my computer, for once.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s see.  Don&#39;t mock any of the below, please&mdash;I almost
certainly wouldn&#39;t have seen them had they not been free, so some slightly
lower quality than usual is to be expected.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll start with the one I just assumed I wouldn&#39;t like, and for
that reason was probably pleasantly surprised:  <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323642/">Piglet&#39;s Big Movie</a>.  Yeah,
seriously.  Oh, there&#39;s no trace of psychological thriller, no twists or
turns, no nudity (which is probably a good thing), and it had the feel of
a clip show whose clips I&#39;d never seen, but was easily the best kid&#39;s
movie I&#39;ve seen in a while.  (Yes, it probably is the only kid&#39;s movie
I&#39;ve seen in a while.)  Two stars.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361462/">Comic Book: The Movie</a> is
one of those things you watch just for a particular cameo&mdash;in this case,
that of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/">Kevin Smith</a>.  Might
as well have fast-forwarded to that part and then hit &ldquo;eject&rdquo;.
Poor.  I <em>hate</em> mocumentaries.  One star.</p>

<p>One of the most idiotic I&#39;ve seen in a long time is one I actually had
held out hope for:  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329028/">Dumb and
Dumberer</a>, the prequel to a much more entertaining movie.  I watched a whole
fifteen minutes of this, so if it gets better later on, I apologize for
misleading the thousands who read this site daily.  Important to remember that
sometimes you <em>can</em> judge a book by its cover.  One star.</p>

<p>And, finally, the most enjoyable of the weekend was <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290538/">Confessions of a Dangerous
Mind</a>, an adaptation of the &ldquo;unauthorized autobiography&rdquo; of
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057567/">Chuck Barris</a>.  Pretty cool,
but pretty strange.  Definitely covers a lot of genres:  comedy, documentary,
action, psych, and more.  Three stars&mdash;watch it if it&#39;s free.</p>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s my computer quota for the day.  Still more on their
way and sitting on the TiVo&mdash;I&#39;ll keep watching &#39;em, you keep
reading &#39;em.</p>

<h2>More movies</h2>

<p>Been watching a few things from <a 
href="http://www.blockbuster.com">Blockbuster</a> and <a
href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> for the last couple of days:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327056/">Mystic River</a>
wasn&#39;t bad, but wasn&#39;t all that great, either.  Certainly not worth
the best picture or best screenplay Oscars it was nominated for (which, I
suppose, may be why it didn&#39;t win).  Directing was fine, but I just
couldn&#39;t get settled onto the edge of my seat;  three stars.</p>

<p>Lindsey got into a movie mode this afternoon, so we watched <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112697/">Clueless</a> and <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304415/">Mona Lisa Smile</a>.  In both
cases, I couldn&#39;t help but compare them to similar movies with men as
main characters&mdash;Mona Lisa Smile was the chick version of <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/">Dead Poets Society</a>, and
Clueless was the chick version of countless high school guy movies (like
pretty much anything with <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131/">John Cusack</a> from before
1990).</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t that these two were bad movies;  I just really couldn&#39;t
identify with any of the characters.  Kind of makes me feel bad for the
countless women I&#39;ve recommended Dead Poets to.  Two stars for each.</p>

<p>Watched the series premier of <a

better than I feared.</p>

<p>And, in a quick update to the review &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; issue I

<h2>Narcotics</h2>

<p>Seriously, I just don&#39;t get narcotic abuse.  Well, that&#39;s not
quite true&mdash;I can most certainly understand doing something that feels
very good with no other benefit.  What I don&#39;t personally experience is
the &ldquo;feels very good&rdquo; part.</p>

<p>Dr. Schnall, the hand surgeon who operated on me a couple of days ago,
was nice enough to give me a Vicodin prescription, even when I suggested
ibuprofen and acetaminophen would be enough.  (Don&#39;t get me wrong,
I&#39;ve been loading up on those.)  Sure enough, I had some trouble sleeping
Monday night (the first night after my surgery), so I decided that last night
I&#39;d take the opiate and zonk out for a few hours, at least.</p>

<p>Trouble is, I think it actually kept me awake.  Took me more than two
hours to fall asleep, and I&#39;m just exhausted this morning.  I&#39;m not
suggesting that narcotics don&#39;t affect me, but this seems very similar to
taking Darvocet and oxycontin when I had leg surgery a few years ago&mdash;it
doesn&#39;t take away the pain, it just makes me care about it less.  Give
me some extra-strength Tylenol any day.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while trying to fall asleep, I did find it amusing at one
point that my hands looked <em>really</em> big.</p>

<h2>Settling in as a 1-armed gimp</h2>

<p>I&#39;m learning to function appropriately one-handed (because of my
<em>cast</em>, you pervs);  it still gets me when I look to my left wrist for
my watch, though.</p>

<p>After a bunch of computer work this weekend, it finally looks like
everything&#39;s working again.  With any luck, that means I&#39;ll also look
into updating my <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing">computing page</a>
again soon.  And once again, mad props to the support team at <a
href="http://www.speakeasy.net">Speakeasy</a>&mdash;they may be significantly
more expensive than SBC, but I&#39;m sticking by my assertion that the service
can&#39;t be beat.</p>

<p>A quick note, though, on the more serious side.  Our class received the
following email today from one of our professors:</p>

<p>To Second Year Students:</p>

<p>Last week, upon completion of my CV pathology review, this file was downloaded off the lecture hall computer to a personal disk without my permission.  Although I did not originally intend to post this review, I agreed to do so after students suggested that it would serve as a helpful study aid.  The overriding issue in this matter is the personal duplication of copyrighted material without consent.  As you know, posting of faculty files to MedWeb is to be arranged through the MDL office.</p>

<p>I have a second, related issue in this matter for which I am addressing the class.  The version of my CV review that I intended to post to MedWeb was not the same version I shared with the class.  The actual file used in my review contained several questions at the very back of it that I retained for my own teaching purposes.  These questions were NOT intended for student distribution and would have been deleted before loading the review on MedWeb; however, this unedited file ended up being loaded to a student website and to MedWeb before I could rectify the situation.  Please understand that some material used in teaching may not be the property of the individual faculty member, but is the property of the teaching program within a department, and as such, is restricted in its use.  I now own the responsibility of releasing unauthorized material to the second year class, with no way of controlling this breach.</p>

<p>I am requesting any student who retained a personal copy of my CV pathology review to delete this file.  I am not in any way interested in punishing the student who initiated this event; I believe s/he acted without forethought, not with malice.  I cannot possibly know that any student who currently possesses a personal copy of my file will delete it; I can only appeal to each person&#39;s individual sense of ethics and professionalism to do so.  This is a very important personal issue to me and I hope that feeling will be respected.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>As many of you know, I have some issues with copyrights.  What should and
shouldn&#39;t be allowed, what is and is not, and what I would do as an author
are some favorite talking points of mine, and nearly all of them could be 
addressed with reference to this letter&mdash;but I&#39;m not going to.  What I
will rant about for a moment is this idea of hiding behind a copyright idea,
even if it&#39;s not one I share.  Dr. Tsoulas made a stupid mistake, placing
this file with its questions &ldquo;retained for [her] teaching purposes&rdquo;
on a computer students have legitimate access to, and having that version
posted on MedWeb, which no student has anything to do with.  She <em>is</em>
correct in saying that she owns the responsibility, yet still blames a student
for downloading the file &ldquo;without [her] permission&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I understand that this is an &ldquo;important personal issue&rdquo;, except
that it&#39;s not a personal issue at all.  Personal issues affect only a
single person, and do not force others to act in any particular way.  This is
a personal belief;  I&#39;m not forcing my belief, and Dr. Tsoulas shouldn&#39;t
force hers.  I hope that every person involved does consider their 
&ldquo;individual sense of ethics and professionalism&rdquo;, and makes a
decision accordingly.  Mine says that if I have the file, I keep it and make
it publicly available.  Another may say differently, and that must be
respected.  But <em>their</em> sense of ethics and professionalism isn&#39;t
one that needs to be forced upon me.</p>

<p>As it happens, I don&#39;t have a copy of the file, or at least don&#39;t
have one yet.  And if it&#39;s a matter of law, that unfortunately trumps any
sense of ethics or professionalism I might garner.  (God forbid I&#39;m allowed
to make up my mind for myself.)  All I&#39;m asking is for readers to think,
and to take responsibility, instead of hiding behind an excuse.</p>

<h2>Slow updates ahead</h2>

<p>Slower than usual, even.  I suppose I should say slower (which is probably
not noticeable to any readers) and less frequent (which may be, but still
probably isn&#39;t).  I had hand surgery this morning to remove a <a
href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/fact/thr_report.cfm?Thread_ID=183">ganglion
cyst</a>, an outcropping of the synovium around my wrist which manifested
somewhat similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, but should go away with this
simple operation.  It was my left hand, so most things are still quite easy,
but typing will take a little adaptation.  Unlikely to be doing any coding
for a couple of weeks, but I&#39;ll have the splint (which is sure to be quite
ripe) off in two weeks.</p>

<p>Some quick updates:  unofficially passed cardiovascular about 10 points
higher than my usual system score, so it&#39;s on to renal.  Saw <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/">Napoleon Dynamite</a> this weekend
and was actually a little disappointed&mdash;2 stars.  Just wasn&#39;t what I
was hoping for, I guess.  Saw <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0324554/">Wicker Park</a>, which was
okay&mdash;3 stars, and also the most French film I&#39;ve seen in years.  A
little creepy, but okay.  Finally, watched <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/">The Butterfly Effect</a>, also
quite good.  Three stars and recommended.  A little creepy, too, but 
surprisingly well done, and not really what I expected.</p>

<p>Oh, as a side note:  for the first time in more than a year, I decided to
pay for a piece of software&mdash;<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>
3.6 (as a pre-order).  Note that this doesn&#39;t go against 
&ldquo;Information Wants to be Free&rdquo;, since OpenBSD doesn&#39;t
<em>require</em> you to pay for their code&mdash;they just ask for the funds
for continued development and a nice package.  I sincerely ask any user of a
UNIX-like system out there to consider a BSD;  some reasons why are on my
<a href="http://www.aleph0.com/openbsd">OpenBSD</a> page.  If you already use
OpenBSD, think about making a contribution, too&mdash;I can&#39;t code well
enough to even find many bugs, but I can give them $45 for a nice CD set and
kick in a sawbuck as a donation.</p>

<h2>Phil Collins</h2>

<p>Actually attended a Phil Collins concert at the Arrowhead Pond last night.
(Officially, his &ldquo;first final farewell tour&rdquo;.)  I can&#39;t say
I&#39;m a Phil Collins or Genesis fan (that would essentially conflict with
my love of power ballads), but Lindsey&#39;s stepdad Jack likes him, and they
got tickets to attend the show while in town.  The disturbing part?  It was
a really great concert.  I knew almost every song, and &ldquo;Sussudio&rdquo;
was outstanding.  Reminded me of one of the music reviews in <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/">American Psycho</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to do some tourist-oriented activities today:  start out
with a cruise down Hollywood Boulevard, down to the La Brea Tar Pits, and back up
to do some shopping and people watching at the Grove before crossing the street
to be in the audience for <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/">Real Time with
Bill Maher</a>;  a little different, and hopefully fun.</p>

<p>Realized I never mentioned that Lindsey and I saw <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/">Garden State</a> (the one with the
guy from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/">Scrubs</a>).  She loved
it, but it wasn&#39;t really for me.  I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it,
since the acting, directing, and camera work were great.  I&#39;d say the
writing was the problem, but there was good dialog&mdash;I think it was just
the story that I didn&#39;t like.  Two stars.</p>

<h2>Lindsey&apos;s mom and stepdad&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;are visiting for a couple of days.  For me, this essentially means
no studying and no classes.  Of course, it was quite likely there would be no
studying anyway, and since tomorrow&#39;s Friday and I still had to go to ICM
this morning, it essentially means an afternoon of no classes.  That&#39;s 
pretty good, I guess.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a bit busy lately (no, not studying for the Cardiovascular
system exam I have next Friday, but still, busy), so haven&#39;t mentioned
my adventures last week.  The most gripping tale involves shadowing my ICM
instructor (who, as I mentioned a couple posts back, is the on-site physician
for a few concert and sports venues around LA).  Not bad&mdash;not much in
the way of medicine, but I got to attend the <a 
href="http://www.vanhalen.org/">Van Halen</a> concert at the Staples Center
last Thursday.  Hey, Sammy Hagar was singing, so the concert itself wasn&#39;t
spectacular, but it was still really cool&mdash;not the least of which that
the suckers who paid for tickets shelled out $65 and up per.  The medicine
was actually disappointing:  a lady with nausea and another with pretty bad
hypertension and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.  Yeah, if I&#39;d studied harder
during Musculoskeletal, I&#39;d remember what that was, too.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular has been okay.  Either I&#39;ve missed a lot of material
during this system, or there really hasn&#39;t been that much.  I guess that
means that either they&#39;re trying to ease us back in or scare us back in.
We&#39;ll find out in another week.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do my best to 
study during that week, but there will be television premieres, and I&#39;d 
really like to finish reading <span class="title">House of God</span>&hellip;</p>

<h2 class="title">Collateral</h2>

<p>Not bad.  Direction was pretty abominable, but mostly just not my style.
Top-notch acting and good story&mdash;I&#39;ll give it three stars, but 
probably not see it again.  Nice to see Jamie Fox in a real acting role;
seeing Tom Cruise reminded me that I still have The Last Samurai sitting on
top of the entertainment center, waiting for me to watch.  Don&#39;t know when
that will actually happen&hellip;.</p>

<p>For the first time in about five years, I visited Fry&#39;s yesterday.
Great move for all the wonderful deals I got, poor move for the ridiculous
amount of money I spent.  I think it&#39;s safe to say I won&#39;t be buying
any more computer equipment for a while.  (Or is it?)</p>

<p>Still playing around with <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>;  
I&#39;m not sure if I ever mentioned that I have this server running
3.5-STABLE now.  I&#39;m working on migrating all the machines over to it,

<h2>ICM Changes</h2>

<p>I won&#39;t bore you with the details of our first <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/departments/family_medicine/education/clinical_medicine/">ICM</a> day this year;  it was mostly logistical and we 
didn&#39;t see any patients.  I also won&#39;t bore you with the details of
how it all came about, but I was required to change ICM groups (no, nothing
bad, just more logistical stuff).  As I mentioned before, I really liked the
group I was placed in for the year, but the new group is great also.  Further,
it led to the opportunity to have Dr. Paul Willis for our ICM instructor.</p>

<p>Okay, I have to admit that this is exciting.  Dr. Willis is very cool, and
has had some interesting life experiences.  He grew up maybe twenty miles from
where I was raised in Florida, and has worked for Disney, a computer company,
and designed sprinklers for skyscrapers.  What most people in our class are
amazed at, though (maybe because I keep mentioning it), is that he&#39;s also
the on-site physician at Edison Field (where the <a 
href="http://anaheim.angels.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=ana">Angels</a>
play, and, yeah, he wears a World Series ring), <a 
href="http://www.staplescenter.com">the Staples Center</a>, and a couple other
venues around LA.  We&#39;re already planning on attending multiple events over
the year.  Very cool.</p>

<p>The most interesting to me, however, is that Dr. Willis would actually be
one of the coolest ICM instructors I&#39;ve met even without his current
positions.  Am I excited to go to baseball games and concerts?  Absolutely.
But he&#39;s also already demonstrated a great attitude and an expectation of
mutual respect.  (Not to mention, from some of the notes I&#39;ve found online
from patients, a great bedside manner.)  But hey, I&#39;m just thrilled to have
any medical instructor who knows what machine language is.</p>

<h2>Busy day&hellip;</h2>

<p>Wow.  Earlier I was wondering if today&#39;s note would be the typical
&ldquo;nothing important happened today;  here&#39;s a movie review&rdquo;
entry.  Turns out no.</p>

<p>The Big Sib/Little Sib barbecue was today, in which those of us fortunate
enough to have survived year 1 of med school are paired with someone fortunate
enough to be just entering it.  As it turns out, my &ldquo;little&rdquo; sib
is <a href="http://packers.com/team/players/michels_john/">John Michels</a>,
former tackle for the <a href="http://www.packers.com">Green Bay Packers</a>.
John really seems like a very cool guy, but I imagine he&#39;ll appreciate it
when people stop approaching him with the obvious celebrity questions.  I
could be wrong, of course&mdash;he must be used to it by now.</p>

<p>Heard an interesting ad on the radio this afternoon for SBC.  Since <a
href="http://www.att.com">AT&amp;T</a> has <a 
href="http://www.att.com/news/item/0,1847,13163,00.html">chosen to stop 
investing in consumer services</a>, SBC has chosen to take the opportunity
to remind its customers that it won&#39;t forget who got it where it is, and
will always treasure its customers.  In my experience, of course, that means
ignoring service appointments, refusing to answer straightforward questions
(real doozies like &ldquo;What&#39;s your last name?&rdquo;), transferring
calls to other representatives without any communication to you or the other
representative, and making changes to your service without asking.  (I&#39;d
like to say this is why I&#39;m now using <a 
href="http://www.speakeasy.net">Speakeasy</a> DSL, but I probably would be
even if SBC weren&#39;t this bad.)  So why do I keep them for long distance?
Very simple.  The last problem I had, at my third request, was escalated to
allow me to speak to a manager.  His name was John Stevenson (of course, this
was by phone, so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s spelled correctly), and he
was nice enough to give me his direct line phone number for the next time
I had a problem.  I&#39;m sure John would like me to pass along his number for
any other complaints or service requests, in the hopes that it will allow
SBC to keep more customers:  it&#39;s (626)304-1735.  I&#39;m not sure this
is useful outside the Pasadena/North Los Angeles area, but feel free to give
it a try.</p>

<p>And a final note of good news&mdash;I&#39;ve been selected for the <a
href="http://www.ama-assn.org">American Medical Association</a> <a
href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/14.html">Medical Student
Section</a>&#39;s <a 
href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/11663.html">Computers and
Technology Committee</a> (no, as of this writing, the <a 
href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/11735.html">CTC Members</a>
page hasn&#39;t been updated yet, but trust me on this one).  It&#39;s
responsibilities range from working on the web site to reporting on 
issues in medical computing and technology to implementing systems to aid
in general business (one of our first goals is likely to be an electronic
voting system for the AMA-MSS assemblies).  Good little resume booster, sure,
but something I actually care about, and can hopefully contribute to in some
tiny manner.</p>

<p>So, yeah, big day.  And of course I didn&#39;t get any studying done.</p>

<h2>Second day&hellip;</h2>

<p>Yeah, school&#39;s back in full swing now.  A full day of 
physiology&mdash;everyone else hates it, but for some reason it&#39;s my thing.
Might have something to do with the fact that cardiophysiology all seems like
physics to me.  That&#39;s actually kind of nice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m biking regularly again (if you consider yesterday and today
&ldquo;regularly&rdquo;);  it sounds scary (it&#39;s not, I&#39;m not doing
anything stupid), but I&#39;ve lost 11.5 pounds since Sunday evening.  It&#39;s
all just water and the result of exercising for the first time in months, but
damn if it isn&#39;t a bit of motivation.</p>

<p>So school&#39;s well, Lindsey and I are both studying hard (she&#39;s got
the third actuarial exam in November), and I&#39;m starting to look into Step
1 of the <a href="http://www.usmle.org">USMLE</a> for next summer.  Only
problems seem to be that (as usual) I don&#39;t have enough time for
everything, and (unusually) I seem to be constantly exhausted.  A little
early in the school year to be beefing up on the coffee ration, but I 
guess&hellip;</p>

<h2>First day of school&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;well, for those of us in MSII, at least.  Today wasn&apos;t
horrible;  it was actually nice to be in the comfortable mental place of
complaining about PPM, talking about movies, and sitting in the lecture
hall trying desperately to pay attention.</p>

<p>ICM group looks great for this year;  I&#39;m looking forward to seeing
how we all interact.  The MDL doesn&#39;t seem bad, either&mdash;a few 
decent folk all around.  Worst case scenario shouldn&#39;t be worse than last
year.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure, though, that it will take plenty of work.  I#39;m planning
to update this regularly (well, more regularly than last year, anyway);
stay tuned.  For now, I&#39;m off to get some sleep (yes, the last edited
time is correct), and I&#39;ll leave you with this final thought:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366551/">Harold and Kumar Go to
White Castle</a> may be the funniest movie I&#39;ve seen all year.</p>

<h2>So much to do&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;and school starts in only two weeks.  Year II, beginning with
Cardiology, may be a bit of work, but I&#39;m <em>so</em> ready for it to
get started (in case it hasn&#39;t been abundantly clear, research this
summer has been somewhat less than fun).</p>

<p>Lots of little and big changes:  I&#39;ve ceased development of <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux</a>, but will leave the
&ldquo;defunct&rdquo; site up indefinitely.  Why?  More than anything, because
I&#39;ve decided to switch most of my systems to <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>;  I even started <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/openbsd">a page about the OS</a>.  I&#39;d still
like to be using only open source software by 1 January 2005, but it will
probably be a mix of OpenBSD 3.6 and <a 
href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> 10.x.  Oh, don&#39;t worry,
I&#39;m sure to keep you informed.</p>

<p>Bought a new <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a> yesterday.  The old one
(which I still have, of course) was beginning to have some very strange 
symptoms, including needing a regular switch of video inputs to work properly.
I finally got a DirecTiVo (which is apparently now called DirecTV DVR with
TiVo service, or something).  We&#39;ll start hacking on that shortly.  What
I can say at the moment, though, includes that the picture is <em>great</em>
(or as great as it can be on a five-year-old television with some magnet 
distortion).</p>

<p>Also saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/">I, Robot</a>
yesterday.  Fun, nothing special, but entertaining.  One of the first real
action movies I&#39;ve enjoyed Will Smith in.  Three stars.</p>

<h2>Sarah McLachlan&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;live, and in concert.  One of Lindsey&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day gifts was tickets to tonight&#39;s show at the Staples Center.  Not bad&mdash;not really my kind of music (think more <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:s7d3vw9va9uk">Styx</a> and power ballads), but entertaining, even if only for making fun of the opening act (who seriously sounded like she was singing &ldquo;Indiana Jones Don&#39;t Cry&rdquo; at one point).  Note to <a href="http://www.butterflyboucher.com">Butterfly Boucher</a>:  angry chick music doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re ugly.  It&#39;s impressive if <a href="http://www.anidifranco.com">Ani DiFranco</a> thinks men are scum, since she could probably get anything she wants from them.  It&#39;s just depressing for this opener to think so, though, just because she can&#39;t get a date.</p>

<p>The most amusing highlight of the evening, though, came from one of the beverage &amp; snack vendors.  As if there were a Laker game going on, before (and occasionally even during) the show, referee-striped men were hawking their wares.  We were there fairly early, so we got to hear plenty of &ldquo;Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi!  Get your caramel corn!&rdquo; from these guys.  When one of them sold a &ldquo;bouquet&rdquo; of caramel corn to a couple of girls a few seats away from us, he chatted with us&mdash;we commiserated the fact that they didn&#39;t sell Cracker Jack at the Staples center, and he complained about hawking peanuts at a Melissa Ethridge concert:  &ldquo;Do you know how hard it is to sell salted nuts to a bunch of lesbians?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll just leave you with that thought.</p>

<h2>Movie Mania!</h2>

<p>Seen lots of stuff recently that I haven&#39;t commented on.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/">Dodgeball</a> several days ago;  3 stars, funny, but not as good as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131857/">BASEketball</a>.  Ben Stiller is terrible, and a lot of the jokes just aren&#39;t that great.  I had a similar reaction to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357413/">Anchorman</a>, but I <em>expected</em> that to be ridiculous, so it was okay.  Three stars.  Will Ferrel was his usual over-the-top self, but the real king was Steven Carell of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115147/">Daily Show</a>.  Outstanding work.  Funny, but go in expecting ridiculous.</p>

<p>Finally, I never mentioned <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327162/">The Stepford Wives</a> with Nicole Kidman.  Not bad.  Two stars, mostly because it was extraordinarily predictable.  There are stories of lots of behind-the-camera problems, and I can say that the movie didn&#39;t show any sign of them.  It just wasn&#39;t that great to begin with.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also just received the second season of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248654/">Six Feet Under</a>;  Lindsey and I have only watched two episodes, but it&#39;s shaping up to be the four-star show that the first season introduced.</p>

<h2>SBC&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;has become a bane.  I&#39;ve used their DSL service for nearly the past year, and have been generally pleased.  The speed never seems to be a problem on my 1.5Mbps down/256kbps up connection.  Over the year, however, I have experienced some connection dropping, sometimes repeatedly having to restart the modem or my gateway.  Last night was the worst (except for when there was &ldquo;maintenance downtime&rdquo;).  Connections would drop every few minutes, stay off for a short time, and then reconnect.  The SBC &ldquo;live help&rdquo; web site went down in the middle of my chat session (though my connection was fine), and the phone help was abominable.  (Of course, they didn&#39;t really like it when they asked &ldquo;Do you use a Windows PC or a Macintosh?&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Yeah, I might have been a little frustrated by that point.)</p>

<p>Long story short, I had planned to not report this until the changeover was complete, but I&#39;ve switched to <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net">Speakeasy</a> DSL.  On a special affiliation with <a href="http://www.osdn.org">OSDN</a>, I&#39;ll get 8 static IPs on a 6.0Mbps down/768kbps up connection with <em>no</em> restrictions on running servers.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes, but it <em>can&#39;t</em> be as bad as SBC has been.</p>

<h2>Almost done!</h2>

<p>Well, almost done with the summer.  Surprisingly, that&#39;s a 
Good Thing&trade;; the summer in the Emergency Department has been fairly
disappointing.  I tend to sit outside a single room for a few hours at a time
(often reading <a href="http://www.emergencyekg.com">Dale Dubin</a>&#39;s <span class="longtitle">Rapid Interpretation of EKG&#39;s</span> or the new survival book I got on clearance for four bucks, just in case I fall in a lake);  it&#39;s pretty much just sitting&mdash;I have to keep an eye on the asthma booth just in case someone comes in, but no one has in the several weeks I&#39;ve been doing this.</p>

<p>My other research project (the one I&#39;m getting <em>paid</em> for) is going a little bit better.  We&#39;ve been able to reach nearly every department of USC that has any significant number of residents, and myself and Jennifer Malin, my research partner, will begin visiting meetings next week to distribute surveys.  That should be fun&hellip; oh, sorry, that was supposed to come out sarcastically.</p>

<p>With any luck, though, I&#39;ll basically have 17 July&ndash;1 August away from school.  I may have to go to those meetings, but since classes start (I think) on 2 August, I&#39;d rather just relax, do some <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing">computer stuff</a>, and watch some movies.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>Just a couple of other quick notes:  <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux</a> 0.4 is almost complete.  There&#39;s a simple feature I want to add (booting from an initrd), and then it&#39;s just building for a few days on the slow computer.  This may be the last time I build it (slowly) to be i586-compatible, since I think I&#39;ll go back to using that old machine as my server.  I recently read <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-openbsd">an interesting review of OpenBSD 3.5</a> over at <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">DistroWatch.com</a>, so I think that after this Infinit build I&#39;m going to try that out for a while.  I&#39;m (probably) not going to be abandoning Infinit, but <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> looks pretty sweet.</p>

<p>One of OpenBSD&#39;s relatives, <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>, is the operating system run by a service I&#39;ve recently rediscovered, <a href="http://www.freeshell.org">SDF Public Access Unix System</a>.  This is an outstanding service which offers a free shell account to <em>anyone</em>;  for a buck you can validate your account (I did) and configure it to your liking, or even throw up a home page (I mean post, not vomit).  This is the sort of stuff I actually <em>like</em> to support.</p>

<p>Oh, cool medical tales!  The first:  a week or so ago, interesting case came in:  woman was down at Women&#39;s and Children&#39;s Hospital (part of LAC+USC Medical Center, but not General Hospital) being interviewed by physicians, when they decided she was having a stroke.  This was fairly reasonable, considering she seemed unable to control one side of her face, was drooling, and unable to speak clearly.  They immediately sent her to the ER&mdash;where it was discovered that her cranial vessels were just fine, and she had spontaneously dislocated her jaw.  Just goes to show you what happens when you jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>The second, and on a more personal note:  I&#39;ve been having a bit of forearm and hand pain on my left for a few weeks;  I had broken my wrist when I was a teenager, so thought it might be that causing some problems.  I went to the doctor on Wednesday, and, cool stuff, I get to see a hand surgeon!  The likely diagnosis is a <a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/fact/thr_report.cfm?Thread_ID=183">ganglion cyst</a>.  It is similar, but presents fairly different from, carpal tunnel syndrome (which is more frightening to me, as there&#39;s not much to do about that, and I don&#39;t want to stop coding).  I&#39;m definitely going to see the surgery myself (I&#39;m hoping they won&#39;t just aspirate it), and I&#39;m going to try to get pictures or a video tape.  Now I just need to review my dorsal hand anatomy in case the surgeon pimps me while I&#39;m under the knife&hellip;</p>

<p>Finally, as I always say at just about any transition (beginning of a new semester, first of the month, Wednesday, whatever), I&#39;m going to start dieting again and trying to post more Real Soon Now&reg;&hellip; and I <em>mean</em> it this time.  No, seriously&mdash;you just watch.</p>

<h2>Being sick&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;really blows.  I&apos;m not one of those future docs who has had a 
lot of experience with personal illness and therefore wants to eradicate
sickness or at least help ease suffering;  I honestly just like the 
adrenaline and problem-solving.  Maybe that&apos;d be different if I had a
greater history of being sick.  As it stands, I really don&apos;t get sick
all that often;  perhaps for that very reason, I don&apos;t handle it well
when I do.  I&apos;ve been &ldquo;sick&rdquo; for about a week, but that&apos;s been normal head cold-type stuff.  Yesterday was horrible&mdash;abdominal, er, &ldquo;involvement&rdquo;, and I&apos;ll leave it at that.  I essentially sat
on the sofa and moaned all day.</p>

<p>Not that that sounds so bad itself;  as Lindsey pointed out, the thing I didn&apos;t like about it is that I <em>had</em> to do that.  If I just felt like sitting around and watching TV, that&apos;d have been fine.  But as it stands, yesterday (and recovery today) has been horrible.</p>

<p>So, back to life as usual (hopefully) tomorrow, and back to the ER on Monday.  About the only benefit to the last couple of days off has been that I finally sat through <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/">Chinatown</a>, by Roman Polanski.  I&apos;ve really got to stop watching these great old movies&mdash;they&apos;re admirable, but just not entertaining.  Therefore, I will refrain from rating it.  Ah, well.  I think we&apos;re going to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/">Dodgeball</a> tomorrow;  I somehow doubt &ldquo;admirable&rdquo; will describe it, but it does look funny.</p>

<div class="blog">

<h2>Hell of a first day back&hellip;</h2>

<p>It&apos;s Lindsey&apos;s first day of work, and I don&apos;t have to be at the hospital until 10:30;  since she gets up at 
six for the ridiculous commute in, that gives me plenty of time, right?</p>

<p>I get up at six with her, relax, watch a <a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com">Simpsons</a> on the <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a>, and start packing up.  I can&apos;t find my driver&apos;s license.  Mind you, this is really no big deal, since I don&apos;t drive to school/work and I can&apos;t come up with any particular reason why I would need it, but it&apos;s a bad sign.  An omen.  A portent.  Evidence of things not seen.</p>

<p>I realize that my license may be in the pockets of whatever I was wearing on the plane on Saturday.  Per my habit, in fact, it should be in my shirt pocket.  It&apos;s not.  It&apos;s also not in the pocket of the sports coat I was wearing. (Yes, I was wearing a sports coat on the plane&mdash;more fallout of the Chicago story I haven&apos;t yet written.)  Therefore, it must be in the pockets of the pants I was wearing when I got home, but I can&apos;t find them anywhere (the pockets or the pants).  And it&apos;s not like this is a big house.  So no license.</p>

<p>Omen, I tell you.  Portent.  I&apos;m dropping a couple of work pants of Lindsey&apos;s off at the cleaner/tailor down the street to have them hemmed.  It&apos;s only about a quarter to half a mile, but I bike it anyway.  Figure I can leave straight from there.  It&apos;s maybe five minutes to nine.  I drop them off, and start trucking it back up the hill toward my house, on the way to the hospital.</p>

<p>I know what you&apos;re thinking.  Well, I have some ideas:</p>

<ol>

<li>Chris, you haven&apos;t biked in a while.  That bike may not be in the best shape.</li>

<li>Chris, you haven&apos;t biked in a while.  You may not be in the best shape.</li>

<li>Chris, you fat bastard, how are you going to bike four miles to school when you have that horrible head cold you wrote about yesterday?</li>

</ol>

<p>And, for one reason or another (hint:  I made sure the bike was in good shape before I left), I just couldn&apos;t make it up that hill.  I thought I was going to pass out.  Sure, I&apos;m in poor shape, but I don&apos;t really tend to get winded all that easily, so I&apos;ll just strike it up to the virus.</p>

<p>Still, not a problem.  No car, no bike, but there is always good old public transportation.  The bus isn&apos;t used nearly as much as it should be in L.A. considering the huge numbers of people going from place to place all the time.  They&apos;re clean, and, as the trip planner on the <a href="http://www.mta.net">MTA web site</a> will show you, you can get to places in reasonable amounts of time during rush hour.</p>

<p>Or you should be able to.  My estimated travel time, in fact, from my house to the hospital this morning is twenty-three minutes.  Not a problem.  Even after showering off the ridiculous amounts of sweat from my short and ill-fated bicycle trip (yes to diaphoretic and short of breath, no to chest pain and impending feeling of doom), it must only be about 9:10.  I head down to the closest bus stop, which is maybe halfway to the cleaner/tailor&apos;s, and wait just a couple of minutes for the bus.  All the time, of course, feeling remarkably obnoxious as I always do in my white coat.  At least I&apos;m in scrubs instead of that ridiculous shirt-and-tie thing.</p>

<p>Okay, I should interrupt here and mention that I&apos;m comfortable saying that all the little things that have happened so far are just bad luck.  Not really much I could have done, and I planned pretty well in case they happened anyway.  Not so much with the next thing.  No bad luck, really, just stupidity.</p>

<p>I got on the bus going the wrong way.  It&apos;s okay, I notice it right away, get off at the next stop and lose about ten minutes.  No, wait&hellip; that was a different universe.  In this one, I&apos;m not really sure I&apos;m going the wrong way for a good half hour, and for about a half hour after that I keep thinking it would be faster to stay on this bus and loop around than to try to catch another bus going the other way.  I really have no idea where the logic of this is stemming from in my brain, as I realize quite well that it doesn&apos;t make much sense, but I follow it anyway, until I see the fading dodo of the urban landscape, an actual payphone near one of the stops.</p>

<p>From there it&apos;s probably what you&apos;d expect.  I call the research coordinator, tell her &ldquo;long story short, I&apos;m stuck somewhere north of Pasadena and <em>hope</em> I can get there by eleven&rdquo;, and wait for the bus going the other way.  It&apos;s the same bus, of course&mdash;the driver has turned around at the end of the line and come back.  I finally show up in the emergency medicine research office about 11:35 (nobody seems to care, and the one person I would expect to, Dr. Henderson, had worked the night before and wasn&apos;t there), walk around the surprisingly slow emergency room for a couple of hours while waiting for a patient with asthma to come in, and leave.  Oh, there was the joy of taking yet another bus home and walking two or three miles from where I departed, but that&apos;s quite minor at this point.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a message from Lindsey on my cell phone (which, of course, I&apos;d earlier forgotten, along with my watch) saying that her first day is going okay, which is very good to hear.  She&apos;ll be home soon, we&apos;ll have a hopefully less stressful evening&hellip; and then start it all over.</p>

<h2>So much&hellip;</h2>

<p>Where to start?  No, this isn&apos;t some depressing &ldquo;call for help&rdquo; or anything, there&apos;s just been a lot since the last time I posted.  I&apos;m unofficially an MSII, since the year one comprehensive exam was a little over a week ago;  however, there&apos;s still a week or more before I find out if I officially passed.</p>

<p>Lindsey starts a new job tomorrow!  She finally decided she&apos;d had enough of academia, and starts at <a href="http://www.wellpoint.com">WellPoint</a>, who (among other things) owns <a href="http://www.bluecrossca.com">BlueCross of California</a> and of seven other states, as an Actuarial Technician.  It&apos;s been big and stressful for her, but I&apos;m very proud.  Oh, and she&apos;ll be bringing in Phat Bank&trade;, too.</p>

<p>I got back last night from a quick <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org">AMA</a> meeting in Chicago.  I&apos;d never been outside O&apos;Hare before, so the city was a fun little experience.  However, I was on one of the convention committees, so I didn&apos;t get to see much of it.  I&apos;ll talk about the conference a little more later on, but for the moment the thing that keeps weighing on my mind is the fact that I caught a cold, probably out in the cold Chicago rain on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Bad time to be feeling like crap.  I&apos;m starting to bike again tomorrow, and it will be my first shift working on an asthma study in the emergency room.  Further, this is the first full week working on a drug rep study myself and another student are doing with the Office of Continuing Medical Education, and I need to be doing a lot to get home into shape for the summer.  As always, way too many projects and not nearly enough time to do them.</p>

<p>And yet, always time to post here.</p>

<h2>One down&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;plenty to go.  Our musculoskeletal system exam was yesterday, and capped off a very hard week of studying&mdash;one likely to be quickly overshadowed by this week, since our first-year comprehensive exam is this coming Friday.  As you might expect, it covers everything we&apos;ve done this year, but supposedly in a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; fashion and in only 140 questions.  Essentially, I&apos;ll be trying to read about 10-15 books and answer something in the neighborhood of 2000-3000 practice questions in the next six days&mdash;and I&apos;m already exhausted and spending my precious time posting here.</p>

<p>But there are a few things I wanted to mention, anyway.  The first is the travesty mentioned in <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/28/2053214&amp;tid=103">this Slashdot story</a>, describing someone who is most certainly now on some federal watch list because he owns a soldering iron and a keg.  I have no idea if the story&apos;s true&mdash;I read <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> hourly, but it&apos;s a conglomeration of mostly-submitted stories, and is therefore not exactly trustworthy journalism (no, not even to the extent that <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> is).</p>

<p>They did, on the other hand, have another story a few days ago I wanted to comment on.  <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/24/1956248&amp;tid=126">It describes</a> an email outage in the Cox service in Florida, which was met by Cox support with the explanation &ldquo;Cox high speed internet is an entertainment service, so we do not guarantee service&rdquo;.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not one of the computer geeks that thinks net access is an inalienable right or necessity for life, and I do often use it for entertainment, but shouldn&apos;t it be considered a communication medium at this point, and supported the same way?  If you couldn&apos;t get your phone messages for a week, or every time someone tried to call they got a &ldquo;disconnected&rdquo; message, would it be acceptable for the phone company to claim that theirs is an &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; service, and therefore not guaranteed?  My opinion is that this is a symptom of the cable companies trying to get into internet service&ldquo;and, having been offerred Cox internet service in Central Florida many times, my suggestion is that anyone who has it or is considering it sign up with <a href="http://www.fastaccess.com">BellSouth FastAccess</a>.  I used them for about three years&mdash;and I can&apos;t recall a single problem <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, on a lighter note, I saw last night (with Lindsey for her birthday) one of the funniest movies I&apos;ve seen in a long time: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332375/">Saved!</a>.  More and more recently, it&apos;s been the case that I&apos;ll enjoy a movie about which I had low expectations.  In this case, though, I <em>needed</em> it to be really funny, since I knew it had no hope of having a real message that would appeal to me.  It was <em>hilarious</em>.  As I&apos;ve mentioned many times, one of my major philosophies includes a lack of evangelism, and this movie made ridiculously obvious everything I hate about those who evangelize.  Four stars.  See it!</p>

<p>Oh, sorry.  Been doing lots of scripting lately for <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux</a>.  It&apos;s going well,
and the entire project is progressing steadily, even if slowly.  Unfortunately, that means I&apos;ve been a bit derelict in my <a href="/~chjones/medicine/medschool/">med school</a> studies;  that will have to change this weekend.  I&apos;ve only got about a week and a half of musculoskeletal left, then a 
week of studying before the first-year cumulative (which seems to be hotly debated, but only about whether it should be called &ldquo;cumes&rdquo; or &ldquo;comps&rdquo;).  Needless to say,</p>

<p>Lindsey and I were having a conversation while making cookies last night (and, no, that&apos;s not a euphemism).  I&apos;ve always been horrible with popular (and semi-popular) music knowledge, and I mentioned the fact that people have a very strange response when I mess up some sort
of music knowledge (like being unable to tell the difference between REM and U2, or thinking that one of Led Zeppelin&apos;s front men is named
Robert Page).  Their reaction is quite simple&mdash;it&apos;s complete lack of understanding.  No laughing, no mocking, no simple correcting.  Just a blank stare.  Lindsey&apos;s explanation?  They don&apos;t grok that I might know nothing about music.  Why?</p>

<p>They think I&apos;m <em>hip</em>.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was my reaction, too.  I can&apos;t believe anyone has ever thought I was hip.  Do hip people spend way too much time on
computer stuff, have blogs they update far too seldom, use the word &ldquo;grok&rdquo;, and make self-deprecating fun of the fact that they&apos;re <em>not</em> hip?  Well, maybe they do now.  I may be so hip that I don&apos;t know what&apos;s hip anymore.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, did you know &ldquo;hoopdy&rdquo; was a word?  Also &ldquo;bling&rdquo;.  See?  I&apos;m hip.</p>

<p>I haven&apos;t been doing a lot of writing for the past several months, just the occasional tongue-in-cheek article for my friend Karen&apos;s zine.  (On the other hand, I&apos;m so un-hip that I thought zines started with the Internet, and that they actually started with the term &ldquo;E-zine&rdquo;.  Lindsey helpfully corrected me.)  In any case, I&apos;ve been reading a few of the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; in the <a href="http://www.socalphys.com">Southern California Physician</a>&apos;s annual writing contest.  They&apos;re horrible, and the winner got a few hundred dollars.  Looks like it might be time to get back into it.</p>

<p>But for now, only time to get back into classes.  Yay!  Two hours of pharmacology!</p>

<h2>Just checking in&hellip;</h2>

<p>Still working hard (although I&apos;m not at school at least one day a week recently), studying the musculoskeletal system and getting ready for the year-end comprehensive in a few weeks, working on a couple research projects for the Office of Curriculum and the Emergency Department, and, as always, filling most of my free time with work on <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, noticed today that <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1051826249450&amp;type=product&amp;productCategoryId=cat01043">Best Buy has broken the $0.60/GB barrier</a> (after rebate).  Still not buying more until the fifty cent mark, but nice to see that progress is being made.</p>

<h2>Done with neuro!</h2>

<p>Well, done assuming I pass.  But I should know this afternoon, then it&apos;s off to my five-year <a href="http://www.hmc.edu">college</a> reunion.  Unfortunately, I won&apos;t be able to take part in a huge number of activities there, because I have to head to <a href="http://socalsymposium.com">an emergency medicine workshop</a> tomorrow;  with any luck, I won&apos;t be exhausted the entire weekend&mdash;but I won&apos;t make any guarantees.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I actually have a significant amount of work to do before heading out to Claremont.  I should mention, though, that I&apos;ve been making regular releases of <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit</a>.  Next release real soon (maybe).  It&apos;s already usable as a decent little server;  next major step is turning it into a desktop replacement.  Before doing that, though, there are several minor bugs and cleanups to work on.  Probably 1.0 (the desktop replacement) will be available mid-summer.</p>

<h2>Happy 04-04-04!</h2>

<p>Of course, 100-100-11111010100 just doesn&apos;t have the same ring.</p>

<p>Saw <a href="http://www.jerseygirl-movie.com/">Jersey Girl</a> yesterday with Lindsey.  Two stars, aka <em>severe</em> disappointment&mdash;but probably because I have been quite the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/">Kevin Smith</a> fan for some time.  I suppose this means I&apos;ll have to change that to being a &ldquo;Jersey Trilogy&rdquo; fan, or maybe a &ldquo;Jay &amp; Silent Bob&rdquo; fan.  (Yeah, all my computers are even named after <a href="http://www.viewaskew.com">View Askew</a> characters.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit</a> 0.3 is nearly ready.  All the finishing touches are in place, only a bit of testing and building remains.  Expect a release by the end of the week&mdash;and this is a big one, suitable for running a basic web server.</p>

<h2>More on Cobind&hellip;</h2>

<p>Yesterday I mentioned <a href="http://www.cobind.com/desktop.html">Cobind Desktop</a>, a new simple Linux distribution based on Fedora.  It seems their download server is a bit hard to reach right now, so I&apos;ve placed a copy of the installation disc on this server. [As of 28 October, 2004, I&#39;ve removed Cobind 1.0 from this server.  Newer versions are now available from <a href="http://cobind.com/desktop.html">Cobind&#39;s website</a>.]  I&apos;d suggest trying theirs first&mdash;if you can reach it, it&apos;s a much faster connection, I&apos;m sure.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve installed Cobind on my laptop (notoriously the most difficult machine I have to run Linux on), and it&apos;s not bad.  Not perfect, by far, but not bad&mdash;certainly much better than I would have ever expected of a <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> derivative.  Still, I think I&apos;ll be preferring my Slackware in general&mdash;and with that, I&apos;m back to enjoying building my own distribution to solve the world&apos;s problems.  Well, <em>my</em> world&apos;s problems, anyway.</p>

<h2>Haven&#39;t failed out yet&hellip;</h2>

<p>I just finished the Neurosciences midterm, and have a couple hours to kill, so I thought I&apos;d mention a few things.  <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit</a> development has been on hold for about a week while I&apos;ve been studying, but I expect to get a 0.3 release out Real Soon Now&reg;.  It&apos;s still an excellent learning tool, but has been coming more slowly than I&apos;d like for a real desktop replacement.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I still plan to develop it, and still plan to use it as <em>my</em> system at some point&mdash;but for the moment, I&apos;m recommending a fairly new development, <a href="http://cobind.com/desktop.html">Cobind Desktop</a>.  Mind you, I haven&apos;t actually tried it yet, but it looks like the sort of thing I&apos;m looking for.</p>

<p>Finally saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>;  not bad, not great, three stars.  Also saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>, and really enjoyed it:  four stars.  Probably the best I&apos;ve seen since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/">Big Fish</a>, which, admittedly, wasn&apos;t that long ago.</p>

<p>I&apos;m getting back into the Linux thing, probably partly because I&apos;ve been reading a bit of <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a>&apos;s stuff.  Oh, I&apos;m not as zealous (or as paranoid/careful) as he is, but he can get his point across.  I&apos;ve ended up not enjoying <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">The Art of Unix Programming</a> from a technical perspective as much as Mike Gancarz&apos;s Linux and the Unix Philosophy.  (Though I&apos;ll admit many disagree.)  However, ESR&apos;s shorter writings appeal to my ideals&mdash;and keep me interested.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve still got plenty of time to kill, so I&apos;ll once again start playing with some scripting tools.  Until next time&apos;.</p>

<h2>Working hard&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;just not really on the stuff I&apos;m supposed to be.  I&apos;ve gotten a heck of a lot of stuff done around the house this weekend, but have hardly studied.  That&apos;ll have to change now, as our neurosciences midterm is only about two weeks away.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t help that I&apos;m using copious amounts of caffeine (about a pot of coffee a day) to stay on my diet.  I slept well last night, but can already tell that won&apos;t happen tonight.  I&apos;m wide awake, but my mind is less than sharp.  So the question is, do I just sleep (and thus not study at all), or do I stay awake (and thus not study effectively)?  Of course, there&apos;s an easy answer to what I&apos;m actually <em>going</em> to do&mdash;stay awake and not study at all.  Maybe watch some more <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165961/">Sports Night</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it&apos;s not like I haven&apos;t watched much TV this weekend.  As it turns out, this is a <a href="http://www.starz.com">Starz!</a> free preview weekend on <a href="http://www.directv.com">DirecTV</a>, so I&apos;ve got a buttload of movies still on the TiVo&mdash;even though I already watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211465/">Knockaround Guys</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265662/">The Rookie</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265086/">Black Hawk Down</a>, and half of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/">Tremors</a>.  All surprisingly good&mdash;or maybe just better than I expected.  Or maybe the coffee&apos;s putting me in more of a daze than I thought&hellip;</p>

<h2>Packard Bell Working Well</h2>

<p>(Don&apos;t worry.  That wasn&apos;t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanging">clanging</a>.)  The power supply I got wasn&apos;t a perfect fit, but I really blame that on the strange proprietary qualities of the Packard Bell one I replaced, not on this one.  The old computer&apos;s working well&mdash;probably better than it has in years.  That&apos;s good;  I&apos;m planning to use it for <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit</a> baseline development (that is, it&apos;ll be the machine I compile everything on for release) as well as for server backup.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll use it for some testing, too.  Surprisingly, I was able to even get the audio (a built-in Crystal Sound 42327) working under Linux with little difficulty.  Oh, sure, I don&apos;t have much use for that on that machine, but it&apos;s nice to know it still works.</p>

<h2>Vacation in Florida!</h2>

<p>Well, that&apos;s where Lindsey is.  Me, I&apos;m at school at 0720 on a Friday.  On the positive side, however, our 0800 lecture is on Psychological Trauma, one of my few non-ER interests in medicine.  I had at one time considered Trauma Psych as a specialty (which is probably an entirely fictional one), and the possibility of psychiatry with no follow-up or chronic disease is still intriguing to me&mdash;but I don&apos;t think I can live without the physical procedures.  Still, I&apos;m hoping the lecture is fun.</p>

<p>Lindsey&apos;s visiting friends for the next ten days, so if I can keep from starving and/or burning down the house (literally, not in the figurative <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=Aek4gtq6ztu44">Talking Heads</a> sense), then I&apos;ll be happy.  I don&apos;t mean to sound like the stereotypical dependent and helpless man&mdash;but it&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve gone grocery shopping.</p>

<p>More Packard Bell drama going on, which would probably stop if at any point I could stop, er, &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; things.  I noticed the power supply fan was not blowing.  Not that this was causing any actual problems, and who knows how long it had been that way, but it wasn&apos;t blowing, and that&apos;s bad, right?  So I decided to open up the power supply and clean out all the dust.  That actually helped, marginally.  My guess is that there was just too much dust, probably even coating the ball bearing(s) of the fan;  it would barely move when powered, but was still better than it had been before.  So, replace the fan, right?  Sure&mdash;except that I must have shorted something, because the power supply stopped working altogether.  Hard to say what&apos;s wrong;  maybe it&apos;s just a fuse, but I can&apos;t tell, so I ordered a new power supply.  I&apos;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>Okay, time to study head trauma a little.  Very little.</p>

<h2>Computer woes, woo-hoos</h2>

<p>I previously mentioned a bit of difficulties with my server, namely the apparent failure of the processor cooling fan.  Keep in mind this is a particularly old machine&mdash;the oldest I own, in fact.  It&apos;s a Packard Bell Multimedia 601.  That&apos;s a Pentium 233 MMX with 64 MB of RAM.  Packard Bell doesn&apos;t even exist in the US anymore;  their remaining support is now covered by a company called <a href="http://www.priorityonesupport.com">Priority ONE Support</a>, who apparently also contracts with NEC and a few other companies.  In any case, this machine has been on its last legs since about 2001.</p>

<p>I bought a new fan and heatsink for the processor for about five dollars.  (Big shout out to <a href="http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/PC+Components_316805/">Gateway PC Components Store</a>, who even had free FedEx shipping for that piddly amount.)  It worked fine, but not long afterwards I started getting very strange errors:  Memory failures (where only half the RAM was being recognized), a complete lack of recognition of the hard drive and CD/RW, and, of course, a CMOS battery failure (which had probably been extraordinarily low for months).  The battery would be at most four dollars, but I wasn&apos;t sure that it would solve the other problems&hellip; would I need a new motherboard?</p>

<p>Packard Bell (like many companies of its day) used tons of nonstandard technology.  This machine uses an LPX motherboard;  a replacement would be well over $100, and the case won&apos;t work with a ATX (or any other kind).  I could buy an ATX board for this processor, refurbished, for fifty bucks, and would shell out another 40 for a new case.  Since I could get a motherboard, case, and fast processor for a hundred, that would be silly.  Do I even bother, then, with the battery, or just chuck the whole thing.  Mind you, I certainly don&apos;t <em>need</em> this computer, but I <em>hate</em> throwing away anything that&apos;s even remotely useful.</p>

<p>Target had the battery for three bucks.  Turns out it&apos;s a fairly standard automobile remote-keyless entry battery.  I readjusted connectors again, put in the new battery, and those problems were solved.  Woo-hoo!</p>

<p>And the only remaining problems are the lack of development since 1997-1998.  As it happens, therefore, I can&apos;t upgrade the BIOS any further than what I have, which therefore does not recognize hard disks larger than 8.4 GB.  I read in the <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/Large-Disk.html">Large Disk HOWTO</a> that this is not a problem for Linux, since it doesn&apos;t use the BIOS.  Let&apos;s keep our fingers crossed.  If I can get past that (and maybe find a cable that will re-enable audio support), this machine may be just fine for basic experimentation and/or development or miscellany.  Or maybe I&apos;ll just put the server back on it.</p>

<h2>Lots of stress&hellip;</h2>

<p>Well, lots of talk about stress.  Our <a href="/~chjones/medicine/medschool/icm/contact.html">ICM group</a> gave a little presentation today, most of it just more of my patented Charm and Bullshit&trade; (now with less Charm!).  Mostly, though, just back to school&mdash;I had a nice long weekend, and it&apos;s always difficult to come back after that.  (And difficult to eat half the usual amounts of calories and sodium, but what are you going to do?)</p>

<p>But there&apos;s more work to do.  A little catching up in Neuro (no, I&apos;m not actually <em>behind</em> in classes, just behind on the extra things I&apos;d like, like flashcards.  If I can spend a couple hours a day on it, I&apos;ll be set&mdash;I think.  Lindsey&apos;s going to visit friends in Florida for ten days (leaving Thursday), so it&apos;ll be the bachelor life for a while.  No, not like <em>that</em>&mdash;I&apos;m faithful to the extreme&mdash;but there&apos;ll be lots of studying, hacking, and movie watching, and probably not much else.  I may bathe.  We&apos;ll see.</p>

<p>Oh, and it&apos;s actually <em>warm</em>&mdash;nay, <em>hot</em> here again!  Sure, that&apos;s great (it means, for instance, that I can start biking to school again), but I&apos;m not exactly an outdoorsy person, and heat only makes me grumpy.</p>

<p>Of course, <em>everything</em> makes me grumpy&hellip;</p>

<h2>It&apos;s been a while&hellip;</h2>

<p>Almost a month, in fact, since the last time I checked in here.  Lots has happenned.  I&apos;m not sure why, but I haven&apos;t yet given up on doing as well as possible in school, instead of &ldquo;just passing&rdquo;&mdash;despite &ldquo;just passing&rdquo; hematology, despite the extra work I put into it.  We&apos;re on neurosciences now, and it&apos;s going well so far&mdash;but we&apos;ve only had a week of it, and that&apos;s about when I thought heme was going well, too.</p>

<p>I had a little server downtime this morning;  Los Angeles Department of Water and Power decided they would work on the electricity for my neighborhood for a couple of hours.  They were nice enough to let me know about, but woke me this morning ten minutes or so before it happenned.  No big deal, but when I turned the server back on, I got a nice yell like a banshee from it.  &ldquo;Hard drive failure&rdquo; I assumed, which wouldn&apos;t have been a huge problem since I hadn&apos;t changed anything in more than 24 hours and everything would have been backed up, but it turned out to be the CPU fan.  So, instead of running out for a new fan, this is now running on one of the other machines.  100MHz faster, three times the RAM, and a Pentium II instead of a Pentium MMX.  Oh, sure, it&apos;s still crap, but I didn&apos;t have to shell out for the extra fan, and I&apos;ll be able to use the i586 for <a href="/infinit">Infinit</a> development, so that will finally be i586-compatible.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I didn&apos;t announce (on here) the new version I put out over spring break, <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/infinit">Infinit GNU/Linux 0.2</a>.  It&apos;s far from perfect, but it&apos;s much closer.  Lots more work in the coming weeks:  I&apos;d like to release 1.0 before April 1, but I&apos;ll settle for 0.3.  Keep checking back.</p>

<p>Lindsey and I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331953/">Club Dread</a> (horrible) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/">50 First Dates</a> (surprisingly good) today.  I actually recommend the Adam Sandler&mdash;just as good as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120888/">The Wedding Singer</a>, but unfortunately without the nostalgia.  Please, in the name of movie watchers everywhere, don&apos;t see Club Dread.  Broken Lizard really didn&apos;t seem to get it this time around.  Check out their <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/">Super Troopers</a> instead.</p>

<p>That&apos;s it for the moment.  Stay tuned.</p>

<h2>Greed is good!</h2>

<p>Okay, so this little note is actually about <em>ambition</em>, not
greed, but I like the quote.</p>

<p>It&apos;s been almost a month since the last time I updated the content
here&mdash;not my longest lag, but nonetheless one I&apos;m not terribly
happy about.  I&apos;d like to say I didn&apos;t update because I&apos;ve
been working hard or busy with medical school, but the truth is I&apos;ve
just been screwing around.  Since I&apos;m starting to pay for that
(not with money or failure, but just feeling a little guilty), I&apos;ve
realized there are only two real possibilities for dealing with that:</p>

<ol>

<li>Stop feeling guilty about it.</li>

<li>Change it.</li>

</ol>

<p>Sure, the first option is tempting, and something I&apos;m normally
quite good at, but not necessarily what many would consider to be the
&ldquo;best&rdquo; solution.  Add to that the fact that I&apos;ll need
to eventually use the fruits of my labor in landing and performing a
job&mdash;not to mention the fact that I actually like and <em>want</em>
to know the material&mdash;and I&apos;m stuck with changing my behavior.
In deciding how best to do that, I&apos;ve reached a conclusion that
I&apos;m not sure I would have agreed with even a few months ago:</p>

<p>Ambition is good.</p>

<p>Perhaps, anyway, ambition <em>can</em> be good.  I&apos;m not talking
about the cut-throat, be-the-best-at-all-costs kind of ambition, rather
<em>personal</em> ambition that encourages one to be the best he can be.
(Why did I switch to third person there for a second?)  In that light,
it&apos;s also important to share that ambition;  not to be a braggart
or to demean or intimidate others, but as an additional motivation.
If I tell my friends that I&apos;m going to lose ten pounds in the next
thirty days, it&apos;s likely I&apos;ll be held accountable for that.
They&apos;ll ask me how it&apos;s going, and thirty days later I damn
well <em>better</em> have lost those ten pounds.  No, it&apos;s not to
tell others they should lose, and it&apos;s not about competing to see
who can lose the most the fastest;  it&apos;s about accountability.</p>

<p>In that spirit, I&apos;m going to do better
on the only real way we&apos;re measured here at <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/">Keck</a>:  I&apos;m going
to do better on the exams.  Sure, there&apos;s a touchy-feely quality to
improving on the more subjective measures like professionalism or patient
care, but the fact is I don&apos;t feel those are my weakest areas, and
it would be difficult to monitor my progress in improving them even if
they were.  Therefore, exams it is.  There are three system exams left
before our yearly comprehensive exam in May or June;  I&apos;m going to
do <em>at least</em> as well as:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Hematology and Clinical Immunology</dt>

<dd>90%.  I&apos;m less than two weeks away from this exam.  In my
last post, I mentioned that the topic was easy.  Sure, it is still the
easiest system we&apos;ve studied so far, but it&apos;s not like I really
<em>have</em> been studying for the last three weeks&hellip;</dd>

<dt>Neurosciences</dt>

<dd>93%.  I&apos;m not sure exactly what to expect from this system.
I know Gross Anatomy is supposed to be fairly difficult (I&apos;ve
heard, actually, that the entire system is supposed to be fairly
difficult), but I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the process parts
of Neurosciences, especially the pathologies.  We&apos;ll see, but I
want to keep improving&hellip;</dd>

<dt>Musculoskeletal</dt>

<dd>95%.  This one&apos;s short.  Plenty of memorization, and only about
two weeks to do it in.  Still improving&hellip;</dd>

<dt>Comprehensive exam</dt>

<dd>92%.  Just after Memorial Day, covering the entire first year.
This is the closest I get to being realistic&mdash;with any luck,
it won&apos;t involve actually staying overnight in the MDLs.  (Okay,
so I&apos;m sure that won&apos;t actually be the case.  Staying up all
night at home, however, seems fairly likely.)  Wish me luck!</dd>

<h2>Could be worse&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;in a lot of ways.  Got grades for the second half of the fall
semester, and the composite score for the whole semester.  I didn&apos;t
ace it, but I didn&apos;t do all that poorly.  Except for the one subject
I didn&apos;t study the way I should have, I was within two standard
deviations of the mean on everything, and overall.  That said, I&apos;m
(still) a bit disappointed.</p>

<p>However, Hematology&apos;s going particularly well.  It just seems
<em>easy</em>;  and I hope I don&apos;t end up regretting saying
that later.  I&apos;m mildly annoyed at some of the instruction (it
occasionaly seems rather pedantic), but at least I&apos;m doing well.
There&apos;s no gross anatomy&mdash;I was <em>very</em> disappointed in
my performance on that exam last term, but I at least <em>enjoyed</em>
the class.</p>

<p>Lindsey did great on her actuarial exam, so she&apos;s thinking
about getting a job.  I&apos;m sure that will go well, but wish us
luck anyway!</p>

<p>For those of you who haven&apos;t noticed yet, thanks for using
a decent browser.  I&apos;ve decided to stop going out of my way to
support Microsoft&apos;s Internet Explorer&mdash;those of you using IE,
I&apos;m sure can see what I mean.  I wasn&apos;t really supporting
it all that well anyway;  it doesn&apos;t really like things like
<code>&amp;apos;</code>.  So, forget it.  This site is more for me than
anyone else, and just about everyone who ever reads the site uses <a
href="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird">Firebird</a> anyway.  If you
don&apos;t, sorry, but I&apos;m going to do it the way the standards
say I should.</p>

<h2>Big fish&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;is most certainly one of the best movies I&apos;ve ever
seen.  Entertaining, thought-provoking, and (gasp) downright
<em>wholesome</em>.  I&apos;m not sure exactly what it is about the
film (yes, film) that makes it outstanding, but Tim Burton has really
got a way of telling a story.</p>

<p>In other news, happy new year!  Lots of resolutions, most of them
vague enough to be struck down by the end of January, but some not
so.  Plenty more dieting, with no cheating&mdash;ever&mdash;this
time.  Working harder in school, biking more often (even if it&apos;s
too cold for a sane person to be biking), and generally getting more
done.  Wish me luck!</p>

<p>Classes start again on Monday (for me, anyway&mdash;Lindsey has
until the 12th), so I&apos;m likely to not get much non-medical work
done after that.  I&apos;m already preparing:  I checked out an
excellent instructional classic, Bates' Physical Exam, from the
library.  I&apos;ll probably end up reading that instead of <a

&ldquo;new&rdquo; novel</a>, which I&apos;d really prefer, and which
Lindsey&apos;s mom and stepdad gave me for Christmas.  Bummer.  I also
got my first otoscope, ophthalmascope, and sphygmomanometer today.
Man, medical school is expensive&mdash;and I ended up spending at
least $200 less than anyone else I know&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Another one bites the dust&hellip;</h2>

<p>No, I haven&apos;t failed out of med school&mdash;I&apos;m
referring to another semester down the tubes!  That&apos;s right,
I&apos;ve (unofficially) passed my first semester of medical
school&mdash;and, since <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/ksom.html">Keck</a> is
entirely pass-fail the first two years, that&apos;s all that matters.
(Another possible way of reading that sentence is &ldquo;I didn&apos;t
do particularly well, but I don&apos;t particularly care.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>So now time for a little relaxation&mdash;<em>very</em> little,
from the outlook:  I&apos;m <em>really</em> close to being finished
with <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/linux/">InFiniT
GNU/Linux</a> 0.1.1, and I&apos;d like to release that today.  If I
don&apos;t, it won&apos;t be until at least 27 December, since Lindsey
and I will be at her mother&apos;s house in Colorado from tomorrow
until then.  Keep your fingers crossed I&apos;ll finish&mdash;with any
luck, I&apos;m running the last test right now.</p>

<p>I&apos;d also like to get a running start for next semester.
We&apos;re done with the &ldquo;Core Sciences&rdquo; section, and on
to individual organ systems.  The next couple of months (starting
bright and early on 5 January) is Hematology and Immunology.
We&apos;ll be doing Neurosciences for the two months after Spring
Break (which, amazingly, is the last week in February), and finish May
off with the musculoskeletal system.  After that is a week of
comprehensive exams (for the whole year&apos;s worth of material, I
think), so the last thing I need to be doing is cramming in the last
few days (as I&apos;ve done for the last several exams).  Don&apos;t
get me wrong&mdash;I&apos;ll be doing my best not to work my ass off,
but I wouldn&apos;t mind actually having a good reputation among the
faculty&hellip;</p>

<h2>Trauma&apos;s not so bad&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;trauma surgery, that is.  So I met with Juan Asensio, my
mentor for the Salerni Mentor program, and unit chief of trauma
surgery service A at County.  He&apos;s an incredibly active guy (a
quick Medline search shows well over a hundred articles by him), and
seems to advise people all over the world.  If I can just get beyond
the whole lack of time at home, trauma surgery could seem like a very
reasonable career choice.</p>

<p>So what happenned to that whole thing about putting off any real
career decisions as long as possible?  Just another side effect of
rejuvenated interest, my friend.  The main reasons I decided to delay
any such decisions had to do with the lack of interest I was feeling
for any of the things I had thought I would enjoy.  However, with all
my rejuvenated interest, I&apos;m happy to be entertaining plenty of
thoughts of career and future directions.</p>

<p>I do, however, have to continue to concentrate on the present.  For
instance, I need to review eleven immunology lectures this weekend.  I
suppose I should get to it&hellip;</p>

<h2>Halloween rejuvenation</h2>

<p>So, as I started to mention in my last post, I&apos;m 
experiencing a sense of rejuvenated interest, formed 
consciously to combat, if nothing else, creeping apathy and
frustration that may better be described as &ldquo;pouncing&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;creeping&rdquo;.  Yes, it may be a bit
forced, but it&apos;s actually quite effective so far.  When
I don&apos;t get something right, I&apos;m not as upset and
I&apos;m more likely to see it as a &ldquo;learning 
issue&rdquo; rather than as a failure.  When I do get 
something right, it delights me.  I&apos;m excited about 
almost everything involved with medical school right now,
probably for the first time in months.</p>

<p>In a spirit of serendipity, I also got an email from my
Salerni Collegium mentor (well, his assistant).  Salerni
is an interesting cocurricular organization that does everything
from establishing a clinician mentorship program for students to
writing an unofficial orientation guide for MSIs to providing
free football tickets and barbecue for the <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/">USC</a> homecoming game.  My assigned
mentor, as luck would have it, is the chair of the primary 
trauma surgery team;  I&apos;m very excited to meet him this
afternoon and find out about shadowing opportunities&mdash;not
to mention just make some connections.  It seems hopeful that
my rejuvenated interest will carry over into career as well.</p>

<p>It&apos;s also working great for home stuff.  Lindsey&apos;s 
working hard in preparation for next week&apos;s <a
href="http://www.soa.org/eande/fall03_catalog/fall03_course1.html">actuarial
exam</a>, an extremely difficult test at the undergrad level, which
still takes a great deal of preparation even for someone with
Lindsey&apos;s background.  She&apos;s doing well in preparation,
but it&apos;s quite stressful for her and admittedly boring around the 
house for me.  However, thanks to rejuvenated interest, I&apos;m
spending time on my Linux distribution, learning introductory Spanish,
and trying to go through the Mega Memory program.</p>

<p>I realize I&apos;ve never mentioned my performance on the 
exams from a couple weeks ago.  I did quite well, certainly passing
everything, and even excelling in a few areas.  There were also a few
areas in which I scored below the mean (biochemistry comes to mind), but
well within the two-standard-deviation cutoff that suggests more serious
problems.  Thanks to a lack of preparation (I think), I did score
slightly outside that range in microanatomy&mdash;still most
certainly passing, but certainly not as well as I&apos;d like.  I
asked to do an informal review with the chair of the microanatomy course,
who also happens to be important in the selection of Dean&apos;s
Recognition and is on the curriculum committee.  He suggested that
since the school has the funds anyway, they pay a third year for a
few hours of microanatomy/pathology integration tutoring.  I&apos;m
sure it will be helpful&mdash;it might even be more advantageous than
trying to study it on my own.  I&apos;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve just started to get into the abdomen in gross anatomy;  
I&apos;m certain today will be somewhat malodorous (isn&apos;t that
a great word?).  I just hope my rejuvenated interest keeps me from
getting sick&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Rejuvenated interest</h2>

<p>So I don&apos;t have as much time as I&apos;d like to write at the moment,
since, among other things, I have ICM again this morning (well, like every
Tuesday morning).  Suffice to say for now that I have a rejuvenated interest
in everything.  It may be kind of forced&mdash;I figure if I just keep telling
myself I have a rejuvenated interest it will eventually become true.  Working
so far.  More later.</p>

<h2>I&apos;m annoyed</h2>

<p>mostly because just about everything pisses me off these days.
I&apos;m annoyed that there was a strong idiot turnout in the
California elections a couple of weeks ago, but when is there not?
I&apos;m annoyed that I&apos;ve started to get unsolicited commercial
email on my USC email account, even addressed to
&ldquo;Dr. Jones&rdquo;, but I get so much unsolicited
&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; email that this single message I received today
shouldn&apos;t be nearly as annoying as it is.  I&apos;m annoyed that
I won&apos;t be at home today when <a
href="http://www.ups.com">UPS</a> shows up with <a
href="http://www.sharpusa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,698,00.html">my
new toy</a>, even though I should just be thrilled that Lindsey bought
me this great little Linux-powered PDA as an early birthday
present.  Mostly, I&apos;m just annoyed that I tend to wake up
perfectly happy and then get annoyed within a half hour.</p>

<p>Oh, so exams were fine.  I won&apos;t have official results for a
few days still, but I ended up above eighty percent overall;  the
exams from a couple weeks ago will be combined with another week of
exams in December, and seventy percent (or so) of the total will be
considered passing.  Shouldn&apos;t be a problem, and I&apos;m mostly
just worried that performing reasonably well on the previous tests
without working too hard simply means I won&apos;t work too hard this
mini-term either.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve got Linux running fairly well on my laptop.  <a
href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> 9.1, at least until I
have my own distribution ready to run <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.  There are still a few minor
shortcomings, most notably the lack of a good, simple, open source VPN
client, so I can&apos;t just sit out in the quad and use the wireless
network.</p>

<p>It&apos;s ICM day again, which means we&apos;ll go over to County
to see some patients, write up our findings in as professional a
manner as possible, and then maybe present our findings to one
another.  That all sounds wonderful, but ends up generally being a
session in which we listen to patients for about forty minutes and
then have no idea what&apos;s actually wrong with them.  However, we
have also just learned to do the most basic writeups, HPIs (History of
Present Illness).  Funny&mdash;it actually makes you feel like a
doctor.</p>

<p>Home life is fine, but Lindsey&apos;s working very hard.
She&apos;s got an exam she&apos;s worried about tomorrow, and the
first actuarial exam on November 6.  I&apos;ve been trying to help out
as much as possible (since I&apos;m not really working all that hard
at school), but she&apos;s mostly stressed.</p>

<p>Off to ICM.  God, I hope I don&apos;t get too annoyed today.  Fat
chance.</p>

<h2>Halfway through exam week&hellip;</h2>

<p>Tuesday was &ldquo;Human Organism&rdquo;, a massive test over
introductory Psychiatry, Physiology, Genetics, Nutrition, Embryology,
and a few written questions about Gross Anatomy.  Wednesday was our
Gross Anatomy practical exam, 50 questions about gross anatomical
specimens.  Today is the exam I&apos;m most worried about:  Cell
Structure &amp; Function, 105 questions on Microanatomy and
Biochemistry.  It&apos;s not that I&apos;m not good in these subjects,
but after the last two days of exams (and the last nine days of
studying), I&apos;m not up for working hard for it right now.</p>

<p>Friday should be easy&mdash;&ldquo;Prevention and Treatment&rdquo;
is made up of Preventitive Medicine and Pharmacology, which, for the
moment, are essentially 98% of the math we&apos;ll study in med
school.  I don&apos;t have too much trouble there.  I&apos;ll
literally spend an hour or two, and be done with it.</p>

<p>Not that I should be terribly concerned, anyway.  I did very well
on HO on Monday, and I think I did well enough on the Gross
practical.  Today could suck, but from all four of these exams and all
the exams in December, I need to get 70% of the possible points.
That&apos;s not just to stay in school;  since Keck is a true
pass-fail system, that will literally look just as good on my
transcript as whoever gets the top score in the class.  The only
motivation I have for doing well is not remediating myself later;
I&apos;ll work hard now to avoid working hard later anytime.</p>

<h2>No more spam in California?</h2>

<p><a
href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/sen/sb_0151-0200/sb_186_bill_20030911_enrolled.html">A
new law</a> has passed in California:  effective January 1, 2003, spam
is illegal.  Period.  No &ldquo;<code>ADV:</code>&rdquo; subject line,
no unsubscribe links on every message&mdash;just no unsolicited
commercial email sent to or from anyone (or even on behalf of anyone)
in the state of California.</p>

<p>A few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How does anyone know my email address is in California?  Sure, the
domains of two of my email addresses give a <a
href="http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/whois/">whois</a> note as
being in California, but the other two don&apos;t.  It&apos;s nice
that the <em>sender</em> has to prove that the email is solicited, but
how does anyone prove they knew I was in California (assuming the
sender isn&apos;t).</li>

<li>How will California enforce such a law on senders outside
California, or, for that matter, outside the United States?</li>

<li>How do I file a claim?</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe it&apos;s time to implement that whitelist after all.&hellip;</p>

<h2>So I&apos;m on track&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;to lose 100 pounds in one year.  Admittedly, I&apos;m only
30 pounds into it, but it&apos;s going well.  The goal is to be at
175.5 by April 24;  I&apos;ll keep you updated over the next seven
months.</p>

<p>I&apos;m also on track to graduate from medical school.  We had our
first practice test on Wednesday, and I did fine.  I didn&apos;t ace
it or anything, and I haven&apos;t been doing what you might call
&ldquo;studying&rdquo;, but I&apos;ve been doing good for me at least.
I&apos;ve essentially halted a lot of extracurricular activities (like
tagging along in the Emergency Room), partly out of time constraints
and partly out of frustration.  The last shadowing I did was very
disappointing, and I don&apos;t need to be disappointed in my career
choice just yet.  Essentially, I&apos;ve decided that everyone does
the same work for the first two years of medical school (and maybe
longer); there&apos;s no reason I have to (or should) worry about a
specialty just now.  Add to that the fact that I can&apos;t even
choose between medicine and surgery&mdash;so why worry.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve completed the very first incarnation of what I&apos;m
calling (for now, at least) InFiniT GNU/Linux.  That is, I have a
completely bootable system made from scratch, and the idea is to put
it onto a live CD-ROM and make the installation process a couple hours
of compiling in front of you.  Don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll do any
sort of &ldquo;release&rdquo; on here, and it&apos;s not exactly the
sexiest distribution (you might think of it as a minimal&mdash;very
minimal&mdash; development environment), but I&apos;ll arrange that
sometime.  Nice to have a hobby outside medicine.</p>

<h2>Surgery&apos;s not so bad&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;almost surprisingly good, in fact.  Our ICM group visited
<a href="http://www.childrenshospitalla.org">Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles</a> yesterday.  Despite the fact that I&apos;m fairly certain
there should be an apostrophe in the name, we had a remarkably good
visit.  I have to admit I haven&apos;t been seriously considering
surgery, probably because I don&apos;t tend to appreciate the
stereotypical closed-mindedness of surgeons, and I like to feel like
more than an overpaid mechanic.  But as we watched a hand
reconstruction on a child with <a
href="http://www.apert.org/apert.htm">Apert Syndrome</a>, I was simply
fascinated.  In some sense, I actually saw the beauty in the way the
tasks were done&mdash;lots of planning out exactly what would be done,
and adaptation to unexpected consequences with ease.  Oh, and they
closed to <a
href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=Afk2gtq2ztu47">Led
Zeppelin IV</a>.</p>

<p>So it&apos;s anyone&apos;s game at this point.  Speaking of which,
I agreed to play what essentially amounts to intramural football
(maybe I&apos;m missing UF already); the only problem is that I just
learned it&apos;s two-hand touch, with no linemen, and only passing
plays can advance the ball.  Um, let&apos;s see; no defensive offense,
no tackling, and no running game?  What part of this is football?</p>

<p>It&apos;s actually a symptom of a much wider condition I&apos;ve
noticed here&mdash;there are quite a few people who are more ambitious
than I, and I&apos;ve noticed that in large part they&apos;re really
not entitled to be ambitious.  They make rules that suit them, they
arrange schedules that suit them&mdash;all of which they&apos;re
entitled to do&mdash;and then they expect everyone else to be happy
about them.  Oh, sure, that&apos;s coming from someone being annoyed
by their ambition, but I&apos;ve gotten over the need to apologize for
being annoyed.  We&apos;ll see how they handle getting slapped down.
(No, that&apos;s not a physical threat.)</p>

<p>In any case, I&apos;m fairly certain that the great comiserator
will be this afternoon&mdash;we&apos;re having a practice exam, which
the second years have apparently mentioned is a great deal harder than
the actual exams we&apos;ll have in three weeks.  Sure, I studied a
little, but I&apos;m not stressing about it&mdash;I&apos;m more
worried that I&apos;ll be annoyed at bitching about the exam than
I&apos;m worried about doing poorly on the exam itself.</p>

<h2>Yay! Microanatomy!</h2>

<p>Okay, so that&apos;s a bit sarcastic.  Truth is, microanatomy 
(a.k.a. histology, a.k.a. cell biology) is one of the lower 
points of my med school classes&mdash;it&apos;s not that I 
don&apos;t see the point, it&apos;s that I just don&apos;t 
really care.  But wow, they really tend to pound it 
in&mdash;I&apos;ve got four hours of it this morning.</p>

<p>But that doesn&apos;t really bother me.  Sure, there are
things I&apos;d rather be doing with my time, but I knew
that would be the case coming in.  The real drags are the things
I didn&apos;t expect, things like not particularly enjoying
standing around the emergency department for six hours while I
could be at home studying (or better).  I did a tagalong (which
is what they call shadowing here, not a girl scout cookie) in
1060, the &ldquo;slower&rdquo; emergency room at County on 
Thursday&mdash;and left before two hours was up.  Maybe it
had something to do with the 30 back pains that were waiting 
to be seen, maybe not.  Maybe it&apos;s just not as interesting
to me as I remembered.  Maybe I&apos;m just becoming more jaded
and less interested in caring.</p>

<p>Psychiatry is pretty cool, though.  Could this be an important
portent of things to come?</p>

<h2>Another day, another -$133.36</h2>

<p>Yeah, that&apos;s a quick-and-dirty estimate of what med
school&apos;s costing me per day&mdash;and is based on last
year&apos;s tuition, doesn&apos;t include books, supplies, or living
expenses, and doesn&apos;t take into account the future interest I pay
on the loans that are providing that money.</p>

<p>But I start shadowing in the ER tonight!  It seems a little odd
that I&apos;m essentially in the same position as I was 3 and a half
years ago&mdash;a little annoyed with what I&apos;m doing and hoping
that volunteering my free time in the Emergency Room will bring back
some hope for a real career.  Sure, I know a little more about what to
expect and will be wearing a snazzy white coat tonight, but I&apos;ll
still be trying to make a good first impression and will be
sacrificing what tiny amount of social life I have.</p>

<p>I&apos;m also slightly concerned that I&apos;m at school at 0655,
and will be here until at least 2300.  I&apos;m a first year medical
student; I didn&apos;t think that was supposed to happen yet.  Oh,
well, maybe I&apos;m just putting in penance for not working very hard
in graduate school.</p>

<p>In any case, I&apos;ve actually been able to stick to the new
schedule I made up for myself, although I&apos;ve admittedly only
sufferred through one day of it.  For those of you keeping track (if
you actually are, please don&apos;t tell me&mdash;it&apos;s a little
frightening), I&apos;ve lost 29 pounds since April 24.  Days like
today should help that even more!</p>

<h2>That&apos;s it&hellip;</h2>

<p>Okay, so I have to get work done.  Digitizing, music, video, and
most especially programming are all now exclusively dedicated to
weekends.  I&apos;ll keep trying to make these little updates as often
as possible&mdash;who knows, without being allowed to program they may
even come more often.</p>

<p>No, I haven&apos;t failed anything, and this is a self-imposed
rule, but this is something I have to do to get through medical school
successfully.  I need to work hard, and I need to spend time with
Lindsey, and everything else has to come after those two.  I already
am unable to spend as much time with her as I&apos;d like; and by my
new schedule I&apos;ll be spending even less.  The only hope is that
it will now actually be with her instead of screwing around on one
project or another.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll probably post my general schedule at some point, so you
can get an idea of what I&apos;m talking about, but anytime you start
with &ldquo;so there are 168 hours in a week&hellip;&rdquo; you
can&apos;t be going anywhere good.  I&apos;m purposely leaving 1230
Friday to 1230 Sunday free every week, but I do occasionally have
classes scheduled on Friday afternoon.  Other than that
&ldquo;weekend&rdquo; I have about an hour and a half
&ldquo;free&rdquo; each evening&mdash;I think it&apos;s safe to assume
I&apos;d like at least ten times that.</p>

<p>So I&apos;m continuing on all the myriad projects I
have&mdash;they&apos;ll just all be going much more slowly.</p>

<p>Changing subjects completely, I got to interview my first patient
today&mdash;or at least I should have.  We went over the the eighth
floor of County (a.k.a <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056758/">General Hospital</a>), and
I was told to interview a patient who was, well, less than coherent.
We&apos;re not talking a problematic accent or tangential rambling
here, we&apos;re talking moans and grunts.  So much for that.  I was
given another patient; this one was stuck in radiology.  So I just got
to sit in while Pete did his interview.  Arrgh.  I suppose I should be
grateful&mdash;some groups didn&apos;t even go to the hospital.</p>

<p>I start doing ER tagalongs on Thursday (six hours I could probably
spend at home, but I suppose it does help the career).  With any luck,
that will also reinvigorate me a bit&mdash;I guess it&mdash;s safe to
say that so far med school&apos;s good, but not all that
enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Back on the wagon&hellip;</h2>

<p>Okay, so I&apos;m merely referring to studying, working on my
personalized <a href="http://www.linux.org">GNU/Linux</a>
distribution, and updating this blog again.  I&apos;ve been trying to
relax, but constantly feeling like there&apos;s quite a bit to get
done.  So, in response, I&apos;ve just decided to get more done and
let that be its own relaxation.</p>

<p>I&apos;m once again working on what is tentatively entitled InFiniT
GNU/Linux, a &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; that I&apos;ll be happy to
share but will be geared only toward the ix86 architecture and will be
optimized for the computers that I own and use, and is therefore
unlikely to be of much use to anyone else.  I&apos;m not particularly
worried about things like the <a href="http://www.linuxbase.org">Linux
Standards Base</a> and the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs">File
Hierarchy Standard</a> (anymore); I&apos;ll keep things generally the
way they are, but won&apos;t make special efforts to do so.  The idea
is to eventually customize (i.e., tear down and build back up) my own
operating system, so there&apos;s no reason to stick with convention
just for the hell of it.  On the other hand, as I would still not
consider myself a guru per se, I&apos;m not going to try and change
things just yet.</p>

<p>Studying has had to kick back into full gear with our first real
patient case, a young man with cystic fibrosis.  My assignment for the
case was fairly straightforward (an analysis of major clinical
problems presented by CF patients and the pathophysiology leading to
them), but took some time.  We also had our first gross anatomy
dissection (the superficial back) on Friday, so that encompassed some
work in and of itself.</p>

<p>Friday also brought our white coat ceremony, so now I even look
like a medical student ready to see patients.  With any luck,
that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;ll be doing tomorrow&mdash;it&apos;s
our first &ldquo;Intro to Clinical Medicine&rdquo; (ICM) where we may
actually have a chance to visit the wards.  It&apos;s going to be
weird to be back in a hospital.</p>

<p>And, obviously, I&apos;m updating this page again.  Keep checking
back&mdash;still more to come!</p>

<h2>I don&apos;t know, man, that sounds like a lot of work!</h2>

<p>So, med school takes some work, apparently.  Actually, it
hasn&apos;t been terribly bad&mdash;I&apos;m just used to doing
nothing for the mathematics department.  I&apos;ll write a few notes,
and then off to bed.  (Actually, that&apos;s also kind of new.
It&apos;s just a bit past ten.  I&apos;ll be getting up at 6:30.
Question 1: how <em>old</em> am I?  Question 2: shouldn&apos;t eight
hours be enough?)</p>

<p>I&apos;ve decided <a href="http://www.georgyforgov.com/">who
I&apos;ll vote for</a> if Gray Davis is recalled.  (<a
href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> has an <a
href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/interviews/03/08/20/1331235.shtml">interview</a>
with her, too.)  The whole recall craziness just reminds me&mdash;do I
move to states with horrible voting practices, or does it follow
me?</p>

<p>We had our first psych lecture today.  Surprisingly good stuff.
Turns out County (uh, sorry, thats LAC+USC Medical Center) actually
has a psych ER.  I&apos;m planning to shadow the doc there at some
point.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thematrix.com">The Matrix: Revolutions</a>
trailer is out.</p>

<p>Since I keep meaning to mention it, <a
href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/westwingtv/index.jsp">The West
Wing</a> is now showing on <a
href="http://www.bravotv.com/The_West_Wing/">Bravo</a>.  I really
enjoy this show, but it&apos;s not for everybody (Lindsey doesn&apos;t
like it, for example.)  If you&apos;ve never watched, <a
href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a> an episode today!</p>

<p>I&apos;m in the process of digitizing a bunch of med books, too.
I&apos;ll let you know if I ever get any fit for the public.  Med
books are expensive&mdash;wouldn&apos;t it be nice if they were
online?</p>

<p>Okay, that&apos;s it.  I&apos;m proofreading this and going to
sleep.</p>

<h2>First day!</h2>

<p>I&apos;ve survived my first day of medical school.  It&apos;s by no
means a trivial thing&mdash;the worst by far was scheduling the
financial aid entrance interview at the end of the day.  The day
itself wasn&apos;t horribly long, but the financial information seems
to be geared toward those who have never even considered making a
budget or cutting costs, something with which I have a bit of
experience.</p>

<p>On the brighter side, however, I am now quite excited about
school.  It&apos;s remarkably obvious that <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine">Keck</a> has made a great
effort to make the students comfortable, happy, and, most importantly,
feel like part of a team.  Much of the education is team-based, with
the entire class of about 160 students divided into groups of 24
&ldquo;cohort groups&rdquo;, which is then further divided into four
groups of six.  I&apos;ve just started to get to know my
&ldquo;ICM&rdquo; (Intro to Clinical Medicine) small group:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Pete</dt>
<dd>Pete is an interesting guy with a deep, resonant voice, who has
been teaching at the high school and university levels for the last
few years.  He&apos;s married and has an infant son; the only drawback
at all is not bad&mdash;his experience teaching anatomy exempts him
from the course, so he won&apos;t be joining us in anatomy lab.  I
assume he&apos;ll still answer any questions we have.</dd>
<dt>Mariah</dt>
<dd>Mariah is also a new parent.  She worked on the Human Genome
Project for some time; interestingly, I met Mariah before&mdash;we
interviewed and toured Keck on the same day.</dd>
<dt>Ronald</dt>
<dd>Ronald is a local Angelino, and has been out of school for some
time.  He has two young children as well.</dd>
<dt>Anne</dt>
<dd>Anne has an MPH, and is repeating her first year at Keck.  I think
this will be a remarkable advantage.</dd>
<dt>Karen</dt>
<dd>I haven&apos;t gotten to know Karen much yet, but her multi-toned
hair is remarkable, second only to Lindsey&apos;s tri-toned look.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The ICM groups are the smallest groups we work in, and we work in
them plenty.  They are our gross anatomy groups, the first groups in
which we work on practice patients, the groups in which we start to
see real patients, and most likely our study groups.  My ICM is all
students who are a bit older and more experienced, something I&apos;m
quite happy about.</p>

<p>Most of the remainder of the day was spent in some simple
cooperation-fostering exercises, like the famous &ldquo;Desert
Survival&rdquo; simulation where a team must decide which items to use
after a plane crash.  Tonight our first homework assignment was to
complete a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which will tomorrow be used in
discussions of different learning styles (I think).</p>

<p>So, I&apos;m excited.  Tired (again), but excited.  If I can get
some good sleep during this orientation week, I think school will be
much more comfortable&mdash;I&apos;m just not sure that will
happen.</p>

<h2>So I&apos;m a little nervous&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;but mostly just tired.  Very tired.  Not a promising
beginning, I&apos;m sure, for starting med school.  Everything starts
tomorrow, if you&apos;re keeping track.  The last week has been fairly
hectic (sorry if you&apos;ve for some reason been expecting me to
write more), with lots of moving, unpacking, and buying stuff.  At
this point, I&apos;m almost (not quite) wondering if med school will
actually be a nice break from making the house more homey.</p>

<p>Wednesday there was a barbecue to meet our &ldquo;big sibs&rdquo;,
second-year med students who have advice and food to share.  Mine is
Tom, and he seems like a really excellent guy.</p>

<p>I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll write more about Tom, the house, and my
first day of med school later&mdash;at this point, I&apos;ve got to
get up in eight and a half hours, while I could probably use twelve,
so I&apos;m going to get some sleep.</p>

<h2>Almost there&hellip;</h2>

<p>We&apos;ve got about 250 miles to go today, and we&apos;ll be at
our new home.  With any luck, we&apos;ll make that by early this
afternoon, get the keys, and be able to move everything in before
nightfall (okay, so this will actually require a <em>lot</em> of luck,
and the nightfall thing is really just a goal; it&apos;s not like <a
href="http://www.xfiles.com/episodes/season6/6x13.html">anything
bad</a> will happen if we don&apos;t make it in time).</p>

<p>We get the truck for another few days and another few hundred
miles, so even though it seems to be a piece of crap we&apos;ll
probably try to get our money&apos;s worth&mdash;buying and carrying a
washer and dryer, maybe an air conditioning unit or two, generally
racing with all the other fifteen-foot moving vans&hellip; alright,
maybe not that last one.</p>

<p>Unpacking can&apos;t be nearly as much of a pain as packing was,
although we will be trying to fit about the same amount of belongings
into a little more than half as much space.  Still, it shouldn&apos;t
be too difficult to unpack quickly; at the worst, everything will be
unpacked and the house simply won&apos;t yet be pretty by the time <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/ksom.html">medical
school</a> starts next Monday.</p>

<p>That&apos;s right, I have one more week before I officially become
a medical student.  It&apos;s a fairly busy week, but I think it will
be a good one.  As I mentioned, we still have to unpack, I have a
barbecue at the medical school to attend and meet my &ldquo;big
sib&rdquo;, I probably need to start picking up supplies and making
sure all my loans come through, and I still need to decide if
we&apos;ll make <a
href="http://www.undersea.com/~kelsey/bbq2003/">Steve &amp;
Kelsey&apos;s keg party</a>.  But I&apos;ll essentially be done
driving (damn, that reminds me, I also have to get my new
driver&apos;s license), and that&apos;s worth it.</p>

<h2>What a difference a day makes&hellip;</h2>

<p>Wow.  Today was a good day.  I don&apos;t know what has made a
difference, but it could simply be that I had a much better
night&apos;s sleep.  Sure, there were still problems (it wouldn&apos;t
be a cross-country road trip without problems), but they just
didn&apos;t affect me as much.  For instance?  Well, it&apos;s
becoming readily apparent that the Ryder/Budget truck I&apos;ve rented
is a piece of crap.  The noise is horrible, and now it actually looks
like the tires are pieced together with electrical tape.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve been staying in decent hotels (just for reference,
that&apos;s &ldquo;decent&rdquo; for poor students, not
&ldquo;decent&rdquo; for employed physicians).  Today&apos;s is the
second Sleep Inn we&apos;ve stayed in, and the second one we&apos;ve
had problems with.  Last time it was silly problems like a lack of
water pressure and the phone that didn&apos;t work;  this time
it&apos;s a bit more personal, apparently including a stubborn clerk
and a trainee who couldn&apos;t properly make a reservation.  Well, we
won&apos;t be staying in any more of these places (even if $50 a
night is a bargain to the $120 we spent at a &ldquo;Super 8&rdquo;);
I assured the clerk of that while using a little of my usual Charm and
Bullshit&trade;.</p>

<p>In any case, this stuff just hasn&apos;t been getting me down.  It
might help that we&apos;re less than 750 miles from Los Angeles;  we
shouldget there sometime early on Monday.  It, again, might be that I
slept reasonably well last night;  thankfully, the air conditioning at
the Super 8 was actually as cold as I like, and that probably
helped.</p>

<h2>On the road&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;and man, is it a pain.  So after way too much work packing
boxes, loading the rental truck, and cleaning the apartment from top
to bottom, we&apos;re finally on our way.  We left Gainesville at
about 10 this morning, met Lindsey&apos;s dad outside Pensacola for a
late lunch, and stopped in Slidell, Louisiana for the night.  The
truck isn&apos;t horrible, but could be a little quieter and have a
little more power (slowing down 15 mph going up the small hills of
North Florida is not cool).</p>

<p>By the way, before you read further, this is going to be one of my
more bitchy posts.  I hate whining, but somehow I don&apos;t seem to
mind so much if I&apos;m the one whining.  In any case, feel free not
to read if you don&apos;t want to.</p>

<p>So we get to the hotel in Slidell, I call Earthlink to find out the
local dialup number, and the Earthlink system tells me that the area
code and prefix are invalid entries.  Add to that the fact that the
hotel phone doesn&apos;t work, we can&apos;t tell the hotel staff to
fix it because they don&apos;t know about the cats in our room, and
I can&rsquo;t call the front desk to enable long-distance dialing (to
use the modem) because the phone doesn&apos;t work.</p>

<p>So Earthlink handles this reasonably well, and allows me to enable
800 number access over the (voice) phone.  I get that working at ten
cents a minutes, only to find that this number only connects at 14.4
kbps.</p>

<p>Essentially, this sucks.  I&apos;m sure it will all get better, but
it has not been a promising start.  Not to mention, of course, that I
have no idea when this will be uploaded.</p>

<h2>Okay, so I was wrong&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;but that&rsquo;s a Good Thing!  As it turns out, I had completely
neglected the idea of temporarily housing this page somewhere else&mdash;in
this case, my <a href="http://www.earthlink.net">EarthLink</a> account, 
which I received free for six months with my laptop and which I had intended
to use merely for the cross-country drive to LA and the first week in the
new place (i.e., until the DSL was connected).</p>
<p>So, I won&rsquo;t promise that updates will be all that exciting, but
there will at least be updates (and, for that matter, a page at all)
during the drive out and throughout the moving process.  I of course
don&rsquo;t have all the <a href="http://www.cpan.org">perl</a> scripts
running on <a href="http://www.earthlink.net">EarthLink</a>&rsquo;s 
servers, but there&rsquo;s no reason they can&rsquo;t run under <a

just spend a few seconds each day to upload the new page to their
server&mdash;or maybe waste some time scripting it.</p>

that there&rsquo;s at least the theoretical possibility of someone reading

<h2>Still packing&hellip;</h2>

<p>Getting ready for the big move, playing with my new laptop (for the more risqu&eacute; of you out there, that&rsquo;s
not merely the top of my lap), and making sure I have immunizations up the yinyang (well, in my arm, anyway). 
That&rsquo;s essentially how I&rsquo;ve been spending the last several days and how I plan to spend the next two to 
three weeks.  We&rsquo;re leaving on the 31st, driving from Central Florida to Southern California, and planning to arrive
about the 4th of August.  After that, I&rsquo;ll suffer through about a week without DSL, get hooked up again about the
same day I actually start medical school, and hope that none of the computers are damaged in the move.</p>

<p>The gist?  This will be the last update for some time, or at least the last visible one for some time.  I do plan to
do some writing, both on some of the behind-the-scenes <a href="http://www.cpan.org">Perl</a> and some articles I&rsquo;ve
been meaning to get to (including why sweatshops are a good thing).  I&rsquo;ll do a bit of writing at the hotels we stay
at, a bit more once we arrive in LA, and (if I can force myself to take the time) regular updates while experiencing
med school.  I don&rsquo;t want to promise anything, but this site should actually become more active and infinitely
(sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t resist) more interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, you won&rsquo;t actually see any of that for a while.  In about a week, on the 28th or 29th, this will
become a placeholder page reminding you that I&rsquo;m in the process of a move.  One of the deficiencies caused by
my desire to depend on others as little as possible is a lack of server colocation&mdash;so the server this is running
on will be in the back of a Budget rental truck along with all the rest of my crap.  Oh, I&rsquo;ll be updating on my
laptop&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll just have to take my word for it.  Everything should be back to normal (or better) by, at the
latest, about August 15.</p>

<p>The other drawback to the impending move and once again having to attend classes is an indefinitely long hiatus on
my GNU/Linux distribution.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll still work on it from time to time, but I&rsquo;ll be making a serious
effort to concentrate most of my energy on cultivating my education and my relationship.  The last thing I need to be
worrying about is building my own distribution from scratch.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ll still be running
Linux, using and developing <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, and in general trying
to make things easy and difficult on myself at the same time;  I just won&rsquo;t be spending my time trying to make 
my efforts suitable for other people.  In a <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Quotes?0096697">great man&rsquo;s words</a>, 
&ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ve learnt your lesson, Lisa:  never help anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, stay tuned.  As always, still more to come&mdash;you&rsquo;ll just have to be patient.</p>

<h2>New address</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;re finally set up with a new address and a
phone number in LA.  I&rsquo;m honestly amazed at how easy things
have been after the debacle of finding a place to live; all the utilities
are already arranged, I&rsquo;ve found a <a 
href="http://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/">DSL provider</a> (who I&rsquo;m not
necessarily thrilled with, but the price is good), and I&rsquo;m actually
starting to look forward to the move.  In case anyone cares, here&rsquo;s
the new address:</p>
<p class="address">719 S AVENUE 60<br />LOS ANGELES CA 90042-4306</p>
<p>Feel free to write.  The phone number is listed, but already on the
<a href="http://donotcall.gov">National Do Not Call Registry</a>, so 
telemarketers shouldn&rsquo;t call.  <a 
href="http://www.anywho.com">Look it up</a> (after August 4) if you want to
call me and aren&rsquo;t interested in selling me anything.  Sorry that
there seems to be more than one Christian Jones in LA&mdash;you might
want to use my address.</p>
<p>Of course, I can always be reached by <a 
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">email</a> at <a 
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">chjones@aleph0.com</a> (at least, until
I implement that spam whitelist I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get to&hellip;).</p>

<h2>rxvt patch</h2>

<p>So I&rsquo;m waiting for my new <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>
<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/model_inspn_inspn_1100.htm">laptop</a>
(which, surprisingly, will probably be here sometime next week), and I realize
that I&rsquo;ll probably be required by the <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/ksom.html">med school</a> to run Windows, so,
it&rsquo;s once again time to set up <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a>.  In
fact, I like running a console so much, that I started playing around with customizing
the cygwin rxvt, and noticed that (like any other rxvt), it&rsquo;s not real pretty
if you start it maximized and have a little unused space.  To remedy that, I made a
<a href="/computing/dev/linux/cygwin/src/rxvt-max-2.7.10-3.diff">patch</a> for
the <a href="/computing/dev/linux/cygwin/src/rxvt-2.7.10-3-src.tar.bz2">cygwin
version</a> to get rid of some of the ugliness.  If anyone uses this and has any problems
(I can&rsquo;t imagine why, it&rsquo;s a nearly insignificant patch), <a 
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2>Terminator for <span style="text-decoration:line-through">President</span>Governor?</h2>

<p>So no doubt you&rsquo;ve heard that <a 
href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/030630/usnews/30california.htm">Arnold is likely
to run for Governor of California</a>.  Personally, I&rsquo;d like it to be unlikely
that he&rsquo;ll be elected, but I can&rsquo;t really say that.  This is the same state
that elected Reagan to Governor before the mad-cap fun-loving not-exactly-laid-back
Eighties (a decade of which, perhaps surprisingly, I&rsquo;m actually quite a fan).
However, I did just see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181852">Terminator 3: 
Rise of the Machines</a>, and I can&rsquo;t imagine this would be an effective political
tool for Schwarzenegger in any state.  Consider the following planks:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Women&rsquo;s issues</dt><dd>At one point, Arnold &ldquo;whirls&rdquo; <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Loken,%20Kristanna">Kristanna Loken</a> (shoving
her head into a toilet), just before literally trying to crush her pretty little
face with his boot.  (Maybe the fact that she actually kicks his ass quite 
thoroughly is to be construed as a triumph for the gender.)</dd>
<dt>Crime</dt><dd>Actual image from the film:  Arnold, coffin full of weapons
in one arm, gigantic machine gun in another, annihilating at least 8 police cars as
the officers run for cover.  The upside?  A screen capture from Arnold&rsquo;s
&ldquo;terminal&rdquo; stating <code>HUMAN CASUALTIES: NONE</code>.  I can
see it now: <q>I nevah said it was okay to kill police officahs&mdash;just fiah at
them and destroy theah means of puhsoot.</q></dd>
<dt>War</dt><dd>Arnold goes to great lengths to help destroy those who are likely
to become his enemies later&mdash;oh, hold on; people might actually go for that
one.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; I very much enjoyed the movie.  I&rsquo;m just not
certain the country is ready for this particular entertainer to be an elected
official.  Yes, I know he <a 
href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/constitution/constitution_transcription.html#2.1.5">can&rsquo;t</a>
go on to the White House, but I would say Governor is quite 
possible&mdash;even likely.  Oh, well, good excuse to register to vote as soon
as possible after the move.</p>

<h2>Woohoo!</h2>

<p>Altogether, it&rsquo;s been a surprisingly good day.  Far from perfect, mind
you, but surprisingly good.  In fact, it&rsquo;s been very good&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just that those high points of the day took such a small portion of time.</p>
<p>Big news first&mdash;Lindsey and I finally found a place to live in L.A.
Actually, I suppose that&rsquo;s not strictly true&mdash;this particular house
(that&rsquo;s right, it isn&rsquo;t even an apartment!) was actually brought 
to our attention on June 25th, but we decided not to take it then.  It&rsquo;s
a little smaller than we&rsquo;d like, but the location is wonderful (three
miles from the med school), and I&rsquo;m very excited about having the 
autonomy that comes with renting a house.  Add to that the fact that the owner
is tangentially related to the medical school, and we come back to the realization
that much more can be done with social &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; than through
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; channels.  It&rsquo;s a Good Thing&trade;.</p>
<p>Other, much smaller but still fun, news, is that I bought a laptop.  Once
upon a time, I had an ancient 486 IBM Thinkpad with a broken display, but
this time I&rsquo;ve purchased a brand-spanking new <a 
href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> <a 
href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/series_inspn_notebooks.htm">Inspiron</a>
<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/model_inspn_inspn_1100.htm">1100</a>
for a grand total of just over $1000 after tax and shipping.  It&rsquo;s not the
cutting edge <a href="http://www.motioncomputing.com/">device I really wanted</a>,
but with twice the processor speed and one-third the price, it was hard to go 
with my heart when the med school packet that arrived today said a laptop was
required.  Of course, it goes without saying that at least <a 
href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/model_inspn_inspn_1100.htm">this
one</a> has a keyboard and DVD-ROM built in, along with an 802.11b card that
I can actually use in Linux.  (Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ll plan to put up
how that goes, as well.)  The notebook should arrive in about two weeks, just
about the time I&rsquo;m packing the rest of my computers for the big move.  If
I have a chance, I&rsquo;ll plan to put up a nice note about it.</p>
<p>The last decent news for today is that I may teach yet one more class
for the <a href="http://www.review.com">Princeton Review</a>.  Always nice to
make a little extra money&hellip;.</p>
<p>As for the bad stuff&mdash;really nothing.  Just stress about everything
that needed to be done for med school and finding an apartment (ha!).  So,
that&rsquo;s over (at least the living arrangements part), and I&rsquo;m 
going to go watch some <a href="http://www.thexfiles.com">X-Files</a>.</p>

<h2>Danger!</h2>

<p>So there is a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/07/02/financial1239EDT0109.DTL&amp;type=tech">story</a> or <a 
href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/934055.asp?0cv=CB10">two</a> (which I
originally noticed at <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/07/02/2149226.shtml?tid=126&amp;tid=172">Slashdot</a>) about Sunday, July 6, and a scheduled
&ldquo;contest&rdquo; to deface as many websites as possible.  If this
isn&rsquo;t one of them, it&rsquo;s probably only because no one gives it a
try.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is just a piddly little thing right now.  In fact, I won&rsquo;t
be surprised if this is hacked, and I won&rsquo;t be surprised if it&rsquo;s 
not.</p>
<p>Thankfully, however, it is unlikely just any little &ldquo;script
kiddie&rdquo; gets in, mostly because I&rsquo;m not running a Microsoft
product which I have neglected to update.  Instead, of course, I&rsquo;m
running some free software I&rsquo;ve neglected to update.</p>
<p>In news of the behemoth, however, I&rsquo;ve just completed my regular
reinstall of Windows XP on my main workstation&mdash;with any luck, the last
one.  Hopefully, this will take me through next year (mostly because I 
don&rsquo;t plan to change anything), and I&rsquo;ll be well on the way to
my InFiniT GNU/Linux Workstation by then.  (One of these days, the complete
details of my plan allowing a perfectly free-software home network will 
certainly be posted.)  Each time I do one of these installations, I&rsquo;m
reminded how difficult it is to get Windows to actually do what I expect.  I
would not have thought a serial port external modem would have to be 
uninstalled and reinstalled four or more times.</p>
<p>So, finally, it&rsquo;s back to the Linux scripting.  In the meantime,
why not check back Sunday and see if I&rsquo;ve been haXored?</p>

<h2>Dammit!</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll preface this with saying that Linux is great, and I use it
because it comes closest to doing exactly what you tell it to do, as opposed
to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp">other operating systems I
use</a>.  (Yes, I&rsquo;m well aware that any computer does exactly what
it&rsquo;s told; but your commands are generally filtered through the OS and
an application or two.)</p>

<p>But, as any good sysadmin knows, that can be a burden as well.  There are
safeguards&mdash;namely, running as little as root as possible.  Unfortunately,
some things&mdash;say, <span style="font-family:monospace">mke2fs</span>,
have to be run as root.  And there aren&rsquo;t really built-in safeguards for
root being an idiot, and not careful, and typing, say, <span 
style="font-family:monospace">/dev/hdc1</span> instead of <span
style="font-family:monospace">/dev/hda2</span>.</p>

<p>I think you see where I&rsquo;m going with this.  On my &ldquo;development
machine&rdquo;, <span style="font-family:monospace">/dev/hdc1</span> is my
archive partition.  I do take safeguards&mdash;such as not mounting it 
unless necessary.  The funny thing is that had it been mounted, <span
style="font-family:monospace">mke2fs</span> would not have worked.</p>

<p>As it is, the scripts I use for development of the previously-mentioned
distribution I&rsquo;m making were already copied onto another partition, as
was the one &ldquo;source&rdquo; package I had made myself.  Unfortunately,
the individual scripts to build each package were mostly lost, as were things
like my todo list, <span style="font-family:monospace">CHANGELOG</span>s, and
bug tracking.  I downloaded the one piece of software I could find which
claimed to recover files from a formatted ext2 partition; I&rsquo;m not linking
to it because it resulted, after my staying up until 3 this morning, in 
recovering a grand total of one file usable to me.</p>

<p>So am I giving up?  Hell, no.  I&rsquo;m not even pissed at anybody 
except myself and the aforementioned recovery program.  I did this myself; one
of the events leading my charge toward GNU/Linux was a similar wipeout of
data on my Windows computer&mdash;one that wasn&rsquo;t perpetrated by me or
by any source myself, my anti-virus program, and <a 
href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> were able to identify.  So,
it&rsquo;s back to square 2 or so;  I just want to be able to get this done
before I move&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Just checking in&hellip;</h2>

<p>Summer&rsquo;s great!  Sure I&rsquo;m actually busier than I&rsquo;d like
to be&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a bit misleading, considering most of it is of
my own doing.  I&rsquo;m finishing up the first version of my own personal
Linux distribution (yes, I&rsquo;ll mention it here some more, but, no, you
probably won&rsquo;t want it), I&rsquo;ve got a good jump on my ER DVDs (a 
process I swear I&rsquo;ll put into detail one of these days), and moving
plans are coming along as well as can be expected.</p>

<p>The best news?  Since the spring semester ended, I&rsquo;ve lost more than
15 pounds.  I&rsquo;m at a pretty steady 2 pounds a week, and I&rsquo;m
losing in a way that it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely to return once the diet is 
over&mdash;not to mention without resorting to Atkins or the like.  If
you&rsquo;re looking for something similar, I&rsquo;ve got to recommend the
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/">Hacker&rsquo;s Diet</a> that 
John Walker, the founder of Autodesk, put together.  Not for everybody, but 
it&rsquo;s obviously working for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also still teaching (just for that little bit of extra cash) at
the <a href="http://www.review.com">Princeton Review</a>.  I give them so 
much credit for my MCAT score, I&rsquo;ve got to give something back.</p>

<p>So, until I get around to updating this page again&hellip;</p>

<h2>Open Source to the rescue</h2>

<p>While looking down through one of the previous stories, I decided to look
in on the <a 
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200347">Mozilla crashing
bug</a>, and, what do you know, it&rsquo;s been fixed.  (Of course, the <a
href="http://www.secunia.com/advisories/8642/">Internet Explorer analog</a>
is still at large.)  I&rsquo;m not one of those rabid &ldquo;everyone should
use open source&rdquo; fanatics, but I&rsquo;m glad to see it seems to be
working for those of us who do.</p>

<p>To be fair, the bug is still existent in <a 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/">Firebird 0.6</a>, the species
of Mozilla I use, and therefore I would assume that it&rsquo;s still in the
posted <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla 1.4b</a> from 
May 7, 2003, just by the dates.  It does seem to be fixed in the latest
<a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest-trunk/">nightly
build</a> I just downloaded.  Nice to see progress actually, er, 
progressing.</p>

went to work for them a few months ago, but until now have only taught one
course.  I&rsquo;ll be spending most of the month of June on the next one,
and I have plenty of other stuff going on&mdash;getting pre-prepared for the
move to California, building my own private GNU/Linux distribution, and, uh,
updating this site on a pseudo-regular basis.  Plenty of stuff.  So, even if
it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&hellip; I&rsquo;ll be around!</p>

<h2>Am I disturbed&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;too easily?  Firstly, I am consistently amazed at the prowess of 
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sorkin,+Aaron">Aaron Sorkin</a>.  He must
be my favorite television behind-the-scenes man; he created and did a hell
of a lot of work on <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0165961">Sports
Night</a> and <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html">The
West Wing</a>, two of my three favorite shows ever to be on televison.  More
importantly, I was just amazed tonight at the fact that a boob-tube program
can still apply enough suspense that it takes my mind a non-negligible
amount of time to come back to reality.  That&rsquo;s what happened tonight
on The West Wing.  If you&rsquo;ve never watched, I&rsquo;d like to 
recommend it&mdash;except that it&rsquo;s not for everyone (like Sports
Night), and it may be too late in the series to get started.</p>

<p>Enough about TV.  I&rsquo;m also mildly disturbed at the state of 
web surfing.  I&rsquo;ve been a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>
advocate for a while, especially after learning that it&rsquo;s easy to 
<a href="http://www.secunia.com/advisories/8642/">crash Internet Explorer</a>
with simple HTML&mdash;no need for scripting, plugins, or anything. 
Today, though, I read that <a 
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200347">Mozilla has a 
similar bug</a>.  So, once again, I&rsquo;m at the mercy of site coders.  Not
that that is a terribly big surprise, but I&rsquo;m really not up to the
task of making sure the entire web works myself&hellip;. [Update:  As of
9 June 2005, these bugs don&#39;t exist in the latest versions of Internet
Explorer or Mozilla;  I&#39;ve removed the &ldquo;crash&rdquo; samples that
were previously here.]</p>

<h2>Ahh, Summer&hellip;</h2>

<p>So it&rsquo;s finally summertime.  <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/905327.asp?0dm=L31AL">Movies</a>
are starting and television&rsquo;s stopping.  Okay, so it&rsquo;s not quite
Summer, but it is getting close&mdash;and it feels like it more than usual.
I&rsquo;m dieting, bored, and not getting nearly as much done as I&rsquo;d 
like.  But this page is still getting updated (even more than weekly!),
my linux projects are coming along nicely (what can I say, I <em>like</em>
reading documentation), and the diet actually isn&rsquo;t too bad.  
Lindsey&rsquo;s out of town at a <a href="http://www.toriamos.com/">Tori</a>
concert for the week, though, which certainly doesn&rsquo;t help the boredom.</p>

<p>On the good news/bad news side of things, though, my <em>last ever</em>
math test is tomorrow.  See?  I don&rsquo;t actually have any <em>reason</em>
to be bored&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t feel like working.</p>

<h2>I should be happy, right?</h2>

<p>No, this isn&rsquo;t some bipolar change from yesterday&rsquo;s post.  I 
just happened upon a <a 
href="http://www.thedigitalbits.com/rumormill.html#0117">rumor</a> that the
first season of ER will be released on DVD on June 13.  That&rsquo;s great,
right?  Even if it&rsquo;s no longer <a 
href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html">my favorite series</a>, 
I&rsquo;m still a fan, so I should be happy, right?</p>
<p>Just one problem.  As it turns out, one of my major hobbies for the last
few months has been ripping the TNT reruns off my <a 
href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a>, editing them up all purty, and 
making some personal-use DVDs.  I must say they&rsquo;re pretty impressive;
more importantly, they&rsquo;ve taken quite a bit of work, with quite a bit
still to go.  I&rsquo;m about halfway done;  I even spent some money to 
recover some lost data from my latest hard drive crash.  (It&rsquo;s a little
difficult to recover 80 GB on the spur of the moment.)  So I should be 
happy not to have to deal with it anymore, right?</p>
<p>So why am I bummed?  I have plenty of hobbies; this won&rsquo;t leave
me bored and aimless.  And before you ask why not just finish this and not
buy the &ldquo;official&rdquo; copies, are you kidding?  Kinda weird little
ideas I have:  if I like something enough to put work into it, I certainly
like it enough to show even a modicum of appreciation those who can do the
job better than I.  (This is also a good argument for donating to free
software developers&mdash;if there were more people with this idea, it
might not be necessary to pay an arm and a leg for decent DVD authoring
software.)  (Of course, I&rsquo;m also selfish enough that I want the
better-quality professional versions.  Surround sound?  I can only hope!)</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll buy the sets.  And I&rsquo;ll keep working on my own.
Sure, I&rsquo;ll have the entire series, probably before Season 2 is 
released in stores.  Seems kind of pointless, though, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<h2>Life is Good&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip;and not just because I&rsquo;ve finally got the behind-the-scenes
work on this site started.  I&rsquo;ve got the most amazing significant other
in the world (so <em>nyah!</em>), I&rsquo;ve almost completed the bout with
mathematics that first tickled then plagued my young adult life, and I&rsquo;ve
been accepted to a medical school that will probably fill the rest of
that early adulthood.</p>
<p>And lo! the semester&rsquo;s almost over.  If only there were a whiteboard
on the door of my apartment on which to put my down/to go list.  (No, 
that&rsquo;s not my &ldquo;to go down&rdquo; list, which I don&rsquo;t even keep.
Anymore.  Really.)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, this site is actually up!  I&rsquo;ll still be doing
some perl work on automating things, but I&rsquo;m actually going to start
