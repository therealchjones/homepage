            &hellip;in a lot of ways.  Got grades for the second half of the fall
semester, and the composite score for the whole semester.  I didn&apos;t
ace it, but I didn&apos;t do all that poorly.  Except for the one subject
I didn&apos;t study the way I should have, I was within two standard
deviations of the mean on everything, and overall.  That said, I&apos;m
(still) a bit disappointed.

<p>However, Hematology&apos;s going particularly well.  It just seems
<em>easy</em>;  and I hope I don&apos;t end up regretting saying
that later.  I&apos;m mildly annoyed at some of the instruction (it
occasionaly seems rather pedantic), but at least I&apos;m doing well.
There&apos;s no gross anatomy&mdash;I was <em>very</em> disappointed in
my performance on that exam last term, but I at least <em>enjoyed</em>
the class.</p>

<p>Lindsey did great on her actuarial exam, so she&apos;s thinking
about getting a job.  I&apos;m sure that will go well, but wish us
luck anyway!</p>

<p>For those of you who haven&apos;t noticed yet, thanks for using
a decent browser.  I&apos;ve decided to stop going out of my way to
support Microsoft&apos;s Internet Explorer&mdash;those of you using IE,
I&apos;m sure can see what I mean.  I wasn&apos;t really supporting
it all that well anyway;  it doesn&apos;t really like things like
<code>&amp;apos;</code>.  So, forget it.  This site is more for me than
anyone else, and just about everyone who ever reads the site uses <a
href="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird">Firebird</a> anyway.  If you
don&apos;t, sorry, but I&apos;m going to do it the way the standards
say I should.</p>

<p>Oh, and only slight money woes&mdash;anyone need a high-priced HTML
coder for the summer?</p>
