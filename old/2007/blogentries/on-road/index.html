            &hellip;and man, is it a pain.  So after way too much work packing
boxes, loading the rental truck, and cleaning the apartment from top
to bottom, we&apos;re finally on our way.  We left Gainesville at
about 10 this morning, met Lindsey&apos;s dad outside Pensacola for a
late lunch, and stopped in Slidell, Louisiana for the night.  The
truck isn&apos;t horrible, but could be a little quieter and have a
little more power (slowing down 15 mph going up the small hills of
North Florida is not cool).

<p>By the way, before you read further, this is going to be one of my
more bitchy posts.  I hate whining, but somehow I don&apos;t seem to
mind so much if I&apos;m the one whining.  In any case, feel free not
to read if you don&apos;t want to.</p>

<p>So we get to the hotel in Slidell, I call Earthlink to find out the
local dialup number, and the Earthlink system tells me that the area
code and prefix are invalid entries.  Add to that the fact that the
hotel phone doesn&apos;t work, we can&apos;t tell the hotel staff to
fix it because they don&apos;t know about the cats in our room, and
I can&rsquo;t call the front desk to enable long-distance dialing (to
use the modem) because the phone doesn&apos;t work.</p>

<p>So Earthlink handles this reasonably well, and allows me to enable
800 number access over the (voice) phone.  I get that working at ten
cents a minutes, only to find that this number only connects at 14.4
kbps.</p>

<p>Essentially, this sucks.  I&apos;m sure it will all get better, but
it has not been a promising start.  Not to mention, of course, that I
have no idea when this will be uploaded.</p>
