            Well, far be it from me to ignore yet another feature made by <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>.  Google's released a few <a href="http://www.google.com/macwidgets/">Google Dashboard Widgets</a>, including a Gmail-watcher that I like and a Blogger widget that I'm using to make this post.  Not bad.

<p>I'm still not really sure where I stand on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a>, but I keep trying things out.  We'll see if I ever get used to it, or use it for more than novelty's sake.</p>

<p>As for Blogger itself, kinda the same thing.  There are certainly features I wish it had which it doesn't, but rather than migrate to another service (before I've even finished migrating to Blogger), I'm trying to find out about other methodsâ€”for instance, making a blog using <a href="http://www.twiki.org/">TWiki</a>.</p>

<p>As for the lack of posting, I'll attribute that to surgery (as a student, not a patient).  With any luck, it won't be that way for the next seven years.</p>

<p>Update (a minute or so later):  The Blogger widget has its shortcomings.  Adding in extra paragraphs, making paragraphs where there were none, making typing happen off the screen, and a difficulty deleting are the few that I found in my first attempt.  (I've fixed this post to do away with the more obvious problems.)  Caveat emptor, even if it's free.</p>
