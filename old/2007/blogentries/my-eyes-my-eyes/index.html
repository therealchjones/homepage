          <div class="post-body">
            I&#39;ve said before how disgusted I am by Los Angeles, &ldquo;The City of Angels&rdquo; (well, I didn&#39;t find it to be that exactly).  Still, little had prepared me for what I saw today.  I parked my car near the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">USC</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/hsc/">Health Sciences</a> campus on my way to an afternoon in the Surgical Skills Lab.  I got out, and noticed that the SUV behind me was a-rockin&#39;.  Despite the clich&eacute;, I approached, and was greeted with the site of a man&#39;s hairy ass bouncing up and down in the back seat.  Luckily, that was all I saw, before shouting &ldquo;Dude, what the <em>hell</em> are you doing?&rdquo;, knowing full well what he was doing.  He turned around (well, turned his head, which was actually preferable) and looked at me.  I said &ldquo;This is a public place!&rdquo;, and he shyly responded, &ldquo;okay, okay, we&#39;re leaving&rdquo;.  A couple minutes later, a clothed woman crawls into the driver&#39;s seat and they drive away.

<p>Wow.  Seriously, wow.  Other than New Orleans, and even then only during Mardi Gras, where does this happen?  We&#39;re on a city street, parked at a meter, about a block from a public school.  Wow.  I seriously couldn&#39;t believe it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really no wonder none of my interviewers in the Midwest or on the east coast were surprised that I might actually want to leave LA.</p>

<p>It does kind of makes you wonder if there was an argument about how much money to put in the meter.  The guy&#39;s all &ldquo;Oh, I only have a dime, I guess that&#39;ll do&rdquo;, while his little mistress is dismayed that those seven minutes of delight probably won&#39;t put her over the top.</p>

<p>As I said to a couple of my friends afterwards, if I&#39;m going to be walking down the street and seeing two people having sex, they&#39;d better be two chicks, and they&#39;d better be <em>hot</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and, just to add insult to injury, for obvious reasons I forgot to put any change in my parking meter.  A forty-dollar ticket was my wonderful ending to the story.  I&#39;d consider challenging it on extenuating circumstances, but I can&#39;t imagine any judge believing the story.  Or maybe I&#39;m just afraid he would.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  Just cleaned up some grammar and typos.</p>
