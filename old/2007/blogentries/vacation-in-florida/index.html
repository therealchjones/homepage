            Well, that&apos;s where Lindsey is.  Me, I&apos;m at school at 0720 on a Friday.  On the positive side, however, our 0800 lecture is on Psychological Trauma,
 one of my few non-ER interests in medicine.  I had at one time considered Trauma Psych as a specialty (which is probably an entirely fictional one), and the possibility of psychiatry with no follow-up or chronic disease is still intriguing to me&mdash;but I don&apos;t think I can live without the physical procedures.  Still, I&apos;m hoping the lecture is fun.

<p>Lindsey&apos;s visiting friends for the next ten days, so if I can keep from 
starving and/or burning down the house (literally, not in the figurative <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=Aek4gtq6ztu44">Talking Heads</a> sense), then I&apos;ll be happy.  I don&apos;t mean to sound like the stereotypical dependent and helpless man&mdash;but it&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve gone grocery shopping.</p>

<p>More Packard Bell drama going on, which would probably stop if at any point I
 could stop, er, &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; things.  I noticed the power supply fan was not blowing.  Not that this was causing any actual problems, and who knows how
 long it had been that way, but it wasn&apos;t blowing, and that&apos;s bad, right?  So I decided to open up the power supply and clean out all the dust.  That actually helped, marginally.  My guess is that there was just too much dust, probably even coating the ball bearing(s) of the fan;  it would barely move when powered, but was still better than it had been before.  So, replace the fan, right?  Sure&mdash;except that I must have shorted something, because the power supply stopped working altogether.  Hard to say what&apos;s wrong;  maybe it&apos;s just a fuse, but I can&apos;t tell, so I ordered a new power supply.  I&apos;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>Okay, time to study head trauma a little.  Very little.</p>
