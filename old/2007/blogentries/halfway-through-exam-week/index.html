          <div class="post-body">
            Tuesday was &ldquo;Human Organism&rdquo;, a massive test over
introductory Psychiatry, Physiology, Genetics, Nutrition, Embryology,
and a few written questions about Gross Anatomy.  Wednesday was our
Gross Anatomy practical exam, 50 questions about gross anatomical
specimens.  Today is the exam I&apos;m most worried about:  Cell
Structure &amp; Function, 105 questions on Microanatomy and
Biochemistry.  It&apos;s not that I&apos;m not good in these subjects,
but after the last two days of exams (and the last nine days of
studying), I&apos;m not up for working hard for it right now.

<p>Friday should be easy&mdash;&ldquo;Prevention and Treatment&rdquo;
is made up of Preventitive Medicine and Pharmacology, which, for the
moment, are essentially 98% of the math we&apos;ll study in med
school.  I don&apos;t have too much trouble there.  I&apos;ll
literally spend an hour or two, and be done with it.</p>

<p>Not that I should be terribly concerned, anyway.  I did very well
on HO on Monday, and I think I did well enough on the Gross
practical.  Today could suck, but from all four of these exams and all
the exams in December, I need to get 70% of the possible points.
That&apos;s not just to stay in school;  since Keck is a true
pass-fail system, that will literally look just as good on my
transcript as whoever gets the top score in the class.  The only
motivation I have for doing well is not remediating myself later;
I&apos;ll work hard now to avoid working hard later anytime.</p>
