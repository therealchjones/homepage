          <div class="post-body">
            I&rsquo;ll preface this with saying that Linux is great, and I use it
because it comes closest to doing exactly what you tell it to do, as opposed
to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp">other operating systems I
use</a>.  (Yes, I&rsquo;m well aware that any computer does exactly what
it&rsquo;s told; but your commands are generally filtered through the OS and
an application or two.)

<p>But, as any good sysadmin knows, that can be a burden as well.  There are
safeguards&mdash;namely, running as little as root as possible.  Unfortunately,
some things&mdash;say, <span style="font-family:monospace">mke2fs</span>,
have to be run as root.  And there aren&rsquo;t really built-in safeguards for
root being an idiot, and not careful, and typing, say, <span 
style="font-family:monospace">/dev/hdc1</span> instead of <span
style="font-family:monospace">/dev/hda2</span>.</p>

<p>I think you see where I&rsquo;m going with this.  On my &ldquo;development
machine&rdquo;, <span style="font-family:monospace">/dev/hdc1</span> is my
archive partition.  I do take safeguards&mdash;such as not mounting it 
unless necessary.  The funny thing is that had it been mounted, <span
style="font-family:monospace">mke2fs</span> would not have worked.</p>

<p>As it is, the scripts I use for development of the previously-mentioned
distribution I&rsquo;m making were already copied onto another partition, as
was the one &ldquo;source&rdquo; package I had made myself.  Unfortunately,
the individual scripts to build each package were mostly lost, as were things
like my todo list, <span style="font-family:monospace">CHANGELOG</span>s, and
bug tracking.  I downloaded the one piece of software I could find which
claimed to recover files from a formatted ext2 partition; I&rsquo;m not linking
to it because it resulted, after my staying up until 3 this morning, in 
recovering a grand total of one file usable to me.</p>

<p>So am I giving up?  Hell, no.  I&rsquo;m not even pissed at anybody 
except myself and the aforementioned recovery program.  I did this myself; one
of the events leading my charge toward GNU/Linux was a similar wipeout of
data on my Windows computer&mdash;one that wasn&rsquo;t perpetrated by me or
by any source myself, my anti-virus program, and <a 
href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> were able to identify.  So,
it&rsquo;s back to square 2 or so;  I just want to be able to get this done
before I move&hellip;.</p>
