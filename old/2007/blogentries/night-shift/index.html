          <div class="post-body">
            It&#39;s my first night shift on Ob/Gyn, and it&#39;s even less eventful than the day shift.  Sit around, wait for someone in labor, send them home telling them they&#39;re not really in labor, repeat.  Yes, really.

<p>Thing is, I really shouldn&#39;t be this bored.  I have a presentation to do in 12 hours for which I haven&#39;t even finished the reading material, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of studying I could be doing (or even&mdash;gasp&mdash;learning by doing), but I&#39;m just sitting here updating my blog.  (Oh, for those of you who bothered to read the last post, yes, this is another update, and I still haven&#39;t finished the archives page, but I&#39;ve decided to say screw it and just not have new posts on the archive page yet.)</p>

<p>So, stream of consciousness it is.  It&#39;s been more than two years since my last night shift;  I&#39;d say that I&#39;ve lost the feel for it, but I really can&#39;t compare.  In the ER, I was working constantly.  Here, I&#39;m sitting and trying to read.  Argh.</p>

<p>In non-medical news, it seems that <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is going to make some product announcements on Wednesday.  <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/">Think Secret</a> says they&#39;re going to include <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0510oct12c.html">new iPod, Power Mac, and Powerbook configurations</a>.  I&#39;ve been wanting a Powerbook for a while&mdash;who knows, if me likes what me sees on Wednesday, I might just go further into debt.  Also, got a pretty good idea of a gift for Lindsey&hellip;.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for now.  I should be at least <em>pretending</em> to read.</p>
