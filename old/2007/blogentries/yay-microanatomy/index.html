            Okay, so that&apos;s a bit sarcastic.  Truth is, microanatomy 
(a.k.a. histology, a.k.a. cell biology) is one of the lower 
points of my med school classes&mdash;it&apos;s not that I 
don&apos;t see the point, it&apos;s that I just don&apos;t 
really care.  But wow, they really tend to pound it 
in&mdash;I&apos;ve got four hours of it this morning.

<p>But that doesn&apos;t really bother me.  Sure, there are
things I&apos;d rather be doing with my time, but I knew
that would be the case coming in.  The real drags are the things
I didn&apos;t expect, things like not particularly enjoying
standing around the emergency department for six hours while I
could be at home studying (or better).  I did a tagalong (which
is what they call shadowing here, not a girl scout cookie) in
1060, the &ldquo;slower&rdquo; emergency room at County on 
Thursday&mdash;and left before two hours was up.  Maybe it
had something to do with the 30 back pains that were waiting 
to be seen, maybe not.  Maybe it&apos;s just not as interesting
to me as I remembered.  Maybe I&apos;m just becoming more jaded
and less interested in caring.</p>

<p>Psychiatry is pretty cool, though.  Could this be an important
portent of things to come?</p>
