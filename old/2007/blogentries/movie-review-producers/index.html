          <div class="post-body">
            Saw the latest musical to make the jump to film today;  let me start by saying this is the first time I&#39;ve seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395251/" class="longtitle">The Producers</a>;  I saw neither the play nor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063462/">the 1968 film</a>.  Why do I mention this?  because the review I heard on <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> suggested that it doesn&#39;t live up to the legacy.  Well, I haven&#39;t noted any previous legacy, so according to that review I was still in for a treat.

<p>Maybe it&#39;s the habit of watching far too much television, the sickness of seeing mass-produced Hollywood crap at the theater, or just reading too many books that have more happening than could ever be placed into a 2-hour movie, but I&#39;ve started to notice that musicals are just <em>slow</em>.  <span class="longtitle">Rent</span> wasn&#39;t too slow, but it wasn&#39;t too long, either.  <span class="longtitle">The Producers</span> weighs in at a fat 134 minutes, according to <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>, but easily felt longer.  (Oddly enough, on second glance <span class="longtitle">Rent</span> is actually 135 minutes.  Amazingly, it didn&#39;t seem half as long as this film.)</p>

<p><strong>Minor spoilers (nothing you wouldn&#39;t get from the trailer) below.</strong></p>

<p>There were some funny gags.  I&#39;ve often hated <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002071/">Will Ferrell</a>&#39;s performances, but this is the best I&#39;ve ever appreciated him.  Outrageous as a former Nazi (or at least a sympathizer), he even makes me want to start re-learning German, if only to make sure I can catch all the jokes in his musical numbers.  The musical within the musical, <span class="title">Springtime for Hitler</span>, is pretty funny stuff in and of itself, but we see distressingly little of it.</p>

<p>All in all, it would be a thoroughly average movie, except that it&#39;s a musical.  Were the music catchy or cool, that might make it better.  In this case, it just makes the movie feel like it&#39;s dragging&mdash;a lot.  Is it necessary to sing a song for every emotion?  Can&#39;t we see actions instead of talking (or singing) about them?</p>

<p>Two stars.  Some funny bits, but I found myself looking at&mdash;nay, studying&mdash;my watch more often than I&#39;d have liked.</p>
