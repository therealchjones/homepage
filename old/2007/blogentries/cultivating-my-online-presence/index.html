        <p>Welcome!  This is the personal home page of <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/">Christian Jones</a> (<a href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">chjones@aleph0.com</a>), a resident physician at the <a href="http://www.kumc.edu/">University of Kansas Medical Center</a> and a computing and information aficionado.  You may know him online as &ldquo;chjones&rdquo; or &ldquo;therealchjones&rdquo;.</p>

          <div class="post-body">
            In anticipation of residency applications next fall, and since <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/us/11recruit.html?ei=5090&amp;en=ddfbe1e3b386090b&amp;ex=1307678400&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">more prospective employers are looking at online personae</a>, I&#39;ve decided to start honing my online presence a bit.  No, this doesn&#39;t mean a politically-correct change to the content of the site, but rather a more strict separation between my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and &ldquo;professional&rdquo; sides.  I&#39;m open about this, and let it be known that I&#39;m not trying to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; my personal side from my future employers or educators, merely that I&#39;m trying to make sure my professional image is the <em>first</em> one they see when taking a look at me.

<p>My <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a> really already says all I care for it to in terms of my behavior&mdash;I <em>do</em> like to have fun when I&#39;m not working, I don&#39;t perform actions I consider immoral, and I&#39;m happy to leave it at that.  Still, this isn&#39;t everyone&#39;s cup of tea, and I&#39;m happy for people not to be exposed to it if they&#39;re not looking for it too hard.  The goal, then, is that from now on people who look for &ldquo;christianjonesmd&rdquo; or &ldquo;ChristianJones.MD&rdquo; will primarily find my professional persona, and those who search for &ldquo;chjones&rdquo; or &ldquo;TheRealchjones&rdquo; will find the more personal, hobby-driven side of me.  Dig deep enough into either, and you&#39;ll find the other&mdash;I&#39;m not interested in falling off the landscape and keeping that from happening.  Quite frankly, if you&#39;re the type of employer who needs to dig deep and not hire me because of something you find that offends you, I&#39;d rather not work for you anyway.</p>

<p>So this will take a bit of work.  The first step is the removal of &ldquo;ChristianJones.MD&rdquo; from most pages of this site.  If it&#39;s in the content, like on this page, it&#39;ll stay;  if it&#39;s just in the template, it&#39;ll go.  Don&#39;t worry, the site&#39;s not going away&mdash;it&#39;s just not quite as obviously linked anymore.</p>

<p>The second step is actually building up the &ldquo;christianjonesmd&rdquo; brand a bit&mdash;searches for that as of this writing actually just bring up a few posts to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> mailing lists that I inadvertently posted to from a different address.  Oh, well;  no real harm done.</p>

<p>The third (and fourth, and fifth, etc.) step is to simply participate more online.  I&#39;ve recently discovered <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>, a social online music scene, and am kind of digging it at the moment.  That, and communities like it, should help build up the &ldquo;chjones&rdquo; brand a bit.</p>

<p>Finally, I may at some point in the future stop referring to myself as a &ldquo;brand&rdquo;.  Not sure&mdash;see <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/thankyouforsmoking/">Thank You For Smoking</a> for more outstanding information on branding.  Highly recommended: 4 or 4.5 stars.</p>
