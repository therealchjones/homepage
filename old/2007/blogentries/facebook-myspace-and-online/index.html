          <div class="post-body">
            There&#39;s been a bit of coverage in both geek and real news lately about privacy at the big &ldquo;community&rdquo; sites like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and MySpace.  Newsweek even had a cover story a few weeks ago which talked about all the trouble college students have been getting into after posting intimate details (or just pictures of drunken debauchery) online.

<p>I&#39;ve had a (very) small share of this.  This site includes plenty of my daily funny thoughts, and some of those thoughts are offensive to some.  Hence the addition of my <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a>, and, hopefully, a little less interest in how this site is presented to the outside world.  Now, I&#39;ve never actually gotten in any sort of trouble, but I have had superiors express concern that others may not be as &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; as they are.</p>

<p>This leads to two points.  First, if you&#39;re not willing to deal with the consequences of posting something online, don&#39;t do it.  It&#39;s public.  People <em>will</em> see it.  Just because it&#39;s on a &ldquo;community&rdquo; that requires a password doesn&#39;t mean you know and are friends with everyone there.</p>

<p>Second, where do we draw the line?  Personally, I feel I <em>am</em> willing to deal with the consequences of posting things online.  I find them funny, I&#39;m (obviously) not offended by them, and am fairly certain I don&#39;t particularly want to work for someone who is.  That&#39;s my choice&mdash;I choose not to censor myself  (much) on this site, but to present myself as professionally as possible on <a href="http://www.christianjones.md/">ChristianJones.MD</a>.  Can someone, even fairly easily, connect the two?  Of course.  Am I trying to actually separate these parts of my persona?  Not at all.  However, I am happy to demonstrate that one is &ldquo;who I am&rdquo; and one is &ldquo;how I&#39;ll present myself&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t complain that you made the mistake of posting a picture of your latest trip to TJ half-naked and didn&#39;t get a job&mdash;maybe you shouldn&#39;t have posted that.  Maybe you wouldn&#39;t have fit in well at that job.  Guess what&mdash;if you do it to yourself, you&#39;re not a victim.</p>
