          <div class="post-body">
            &hellip;plenty to go.  Our musculoskeletal system exam was yesterday, and capped off 
a very hard week of studying&mdash;one likely to be quickly overshadowed by this 
week, since our first-year comprehensive exam is this coming Friday.  As you 
might expect, it covers everything we&apos;ve done this year, but supposedly in 
a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; fashion and in only 140 questions.  Essentially, 
I&apos;ll be trying to read about 10-15 books and answer something in the 
neighborhood of 2000-3000 practice questions in the next six days&mdash;and 
I&apos;m already exhausted and spending my precious time posting here.

<p>But there are a few things I wanted to mention, anyway.  The first is the travesty mentioned in <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/28/2053214&amp;tid=103">this Slashdot story</a>, describing someone who is most certainly now on some federal watch list because he owns a soldering iron and a keg.  I have no idea if the story&apos;s true&mdash;I read <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> hourly, but it&apos;s a conglomeration of mostly-submitted stories, and is therefore not exactly trustworthy journalism (no, not even to theextent that <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> is).</p>

<p>They did, on the other hand, have another story a few days ago I wanted to comment on.  <a 
href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/24/1956248&amp;tid=126">It describes</a> an email outage in the Cox service in Florida, which was met by Cox support with the explanation &ldquo;Cox high speed internet is an entertainment service, so we do not guarantee service&rdquo;.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not one of the computer geeks that thinks net access is an inalienable right or necessity for life, and I do often use it for entertainment, but shouldn&apos;t it be considered a communication medium at this point, and supported the same way?  If you couldn&apos;t get your phone messages for a week, or every time someone tried to call they got a &ldquo;disconnected&rdquo; message, would it be acceptable for the phone company to claim that theirs is an &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; service, and therefore not guaranteed?  My opinion is that this is a symptom of the cable companies trying to get into internet service&ldquo;and, having been offerred Cox internet service in Central Florida many times, my suggestion is that anyone who has it or is considering it sign up with <a href="http://www.fastaccess.com">BellSouth FastAccess</a>.  I used them for aboutthree years&mdash;and I can&apos;t recall a single problem <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, on a lighter note, I saw last night (with Lindsey for her birthday) one of the funniest movies I&apos;ve seen in a long time: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332375/">Saved!</a>.  More and more recently, it&apos;s been the case that I&apos;ll enjoy a movie about which I had low expectations.  In this case, though, I <em>needed</em> it to be really funny, since I knew it had no hope of having a real message that would appeal to me.  It was <em>hilarious</em>.  As I&apos;ve mentioned many times, one of my major philosophies includes a lack of evangelism, and this movie made ridiculously obvious everything I hate about those who evangelize.  Four stars.  See it!</p>
