            I previously mentioned a bit of difficulties with my server, namely the apparent failure of the processor cooling fan.  Keep in mind this is a particularly old machine&mdash;the oldest I own, in fact.  It&apos;s a Packard Bell Multimedia
 601.  That&apos;s a Pentium 233 MMX with 64 MB of RAM.  Packard Bell doesn&apos;t even exist in the US anymore;  their remaining support is now covered by a company called <a href="http://www.priorityonesupport.com">Priority ONE Support</a>, who apparently also contracts with NEC and a few other companies.  In any case, this machine has been on its last legs since about 2001.

<p>I bought a new fan and heatsink for the processor for about five dollars.  (Big shout out to <a href="http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/PC+Components_316805/">Gateway PC Components Store</a>, who even had free FedEx shipping for that piddly amount.)  It worked fine, but not long afterwards I started getting very strange errors:  Memory failures (where only half the RAM was being recognized), a complete lack of recognition of the hard drive and CD/RW, and, of course, a CMOS battery failure (which had probably been extraordinarily low for months).  The battery would be at most four dollars, but I wasn&apos;t sure that it would solve the other problems&hellip; would I need a new motherboard?</p>

<p>Packard Bell (like many companies of its day) used tons of nonstandard technology.  This machine uses an LPX motherboard;  a replacement would be well over $100, and the case won&apos;t work with a ATX (or any other kind).  I could buy an ATX board for this processor, refurbished, for fifty bucks, and would shell out another 40 for a new case.  Since I could get a motherboard, case, and fast processor for a hundred, that would be silly.  Do I even bother, then, with the battery, or just chuck the whole thing.  Mind you, I certainly don&apos;t <em>need</em> this computer, but I <em>hate</em> throwing away anything that&apos;s even remotely useful.</p>

<p>Target had the battery for three bucks.  Turns out it&apos;s a fairly standard automobile remote-keyless entry battery.  I readjusted connectors again, put in the new battery, and those problems were solved.  Woo-hoo!</p>

<p>And the only remaining problems are the lack of development since 1997-1998. 
 As it happens, therefore, I can&apos;t upgrade the BIOS any further than what I
 have, which therefore does not recognize hard disks larger than 8.4 GB.  I read
 in the <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/Large-Disk.html">Large Disk HOWTO</a> that this is not a problem for Linux, since it doesn&apos;t use the BIOS.  Let&apos;s keep our fingers crossed.  If I can get past that (and maybe find 
a cable that will re-enable audio support), this machine may be just fine for basic experimentation and/or development or miscellany.  Or maybe I&apos;ll just put the server back on it.</p>
