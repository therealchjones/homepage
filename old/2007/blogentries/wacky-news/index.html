I know all my reader is thrilled.

<p>Alright, just a couple of interesting news stories plucked from <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">MSNBC</a> today.  (Yes, I read MSNBC.  Yes, it&#39;s a joint venture of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/">NBC</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>.  It&#39;s still my choice for news&mdash;and as long as there is actually a choice, I won&#39;t complain about it&hellip; much.)</p>

<dt>Die, and get a free upgrade to first class!</dt>
<dd>An elderly woman died after take-off on a flight from Delhi to London;  <a
href="http://www.britishairways.com/">British Airways</a> flight attendants were kind enough to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17683917/">move her from coach to first class</a> <em>at no additional charge!</em>  I was particularly horrimused at the fact that her body kept falling to the floor, and had to be propped up with pillows.  So <em>that&#39;s</em> why I can never get a pillow on a long flight.</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;Bong Hits 4 Jesus&rdquo; goes to the Supreme Court</dt>
<dd>A kid after my own heart <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17687386/">unfurled a banner reading &ldquo;Bong Hits 4 Jesus&rdquo;</a> just to be &ldquo;provocative&rdquo;.  It was during a school-sponsored event, but outside the school itself.  That was a long time ago, and since then his father&#39;s been fired and the student himself was caught (shockingly) selling pot.  I&#39;m particularly interested in the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Starr">Ken Starr</a> (not the rapper) is representing the school that suspended the kid, and that there doesn&#39;t seem to be an argument about freedom of religion here.</dd>
