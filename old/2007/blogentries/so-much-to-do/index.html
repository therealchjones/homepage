            &hellip;and school starts in only two weeks.  Year II, beginning with
Cardiology, may be a bit of work, but I&#39;m <em>so</em> ready for it to
get started (in case it hasn&#39;t been abundantly clear, research this
summer has been somewhat less than fun).

<p>Lots of little and big changes:  I&#39;ve ceased development of <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/linux/">Infinit GNU/Linux</a>, but will leave the
&ldquo;defunct&rdquo; site up indefinitely.  Why?  More than anything, because
I&#39;ve decided to switch most of my systems to <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>;  I even started <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/openbsd/">a page about the OS</a>.  I&#39;d still
like to be using only open source software by 1 January 2005, but it will
probably be a mix of OpenBSD 3.6 and <a
href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> 10.x.  Oh, don&#39;t worry,
I&#39;m sure to keep you informed.</p>

<p>Bought a new <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a> yesterday.  The old one
(which I still have, of course) was beginning to have some very strange
symptoms, including needing a regular switch of video inputs to work properly.
I finally got a DirecTiVo (which is apparently now called DirecTV DVR with
TiVo service, or something).  We&#39;ll start hacking on that shortly.  What
I can say at the moment, though, includes that the picture is <em>great</em>
(or as great as it can be on a five-year-old television with some magnet
distortion).</p>

<p>Also saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/">I, Robot</a>
yesterday.  Fun, nothing special, but entertaining.  One of the first real
action movies I&#39;ve enjoyed Will Smith in.  Three stars.</p>
