          <div class="post-body">
            I&apos;ve survived my first day of medical school.  It&apos;s by no
means a trivial thing&mdash;the worst by far was scheduling the
financial aid entrance interview at the end of the day.  The day
itself wasn&apos;t horribly long, but the financial information seems
to be geared toward those who have never even considered making a
budget or cutting costs, something with which I have a bit of
experience.

<p>On the brighter side, however, I am now quite excited about
school.  It&apos;s remarkably obvious that <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine">Keck</a> has made a great
effort to make the students comfortable, happy, and, most importantly,
feel like part of a team.  Much of the education is team-based, with
the entire class of about 160 students divided into groups of 24
&ldquo;cohort groups&rdquo;, which is then further divided into four
groups of six.  I&apos;ve just started to get to know my
&ldquo;ICM&rdquo; (Intro to Clinical Medicine) small group:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Pete</dt>
<dd>Pete is an interesting guy with a deep, resonant voice, who has
been teaching at the high school and university levels for the last
few years.  He&apos;s married and has an infant son; the only drawback
at all is not bad&mdash;his experience teaching anatomy exempts him
from the course, so he won&apos;t be joining us in anatomy lab.  I
assume he&apos;ll still answer any questions we have.</dd>
<dt>Mariah</dt>
<dd>Mariah is also a new parent.  She worked on the Human Genome
Project for some time; interestingly, I met Mariah before&mdash;we
interviewed and toured Keck on the same day.</dd>
<dt>Ronald</dt>
<dd>Ronald is a local Angelino, and has been out of school for some
time.  He has two young children as well.</dd>
<dt>Anne</dt>
<dd>Anne has an MPH, and is repeating her first year at Keck.  I think
this will be a remarkable advantage.</dd>
<dt>Karen</dt>
<dd>I haven&apos;t gotten to know Karen much yet, but her multi-toned
hair is remarkable, second only to Lindsey&apos;s tri-toned look.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The ICM groups are the smallest groups we work in, and we work in
them plenty.  They are our gross anatomy groups, the first groups in
which we work on practice patients, the groups in which we start to
see real patients, and most likely our study groups.  My ICM is all
students who are a bit older and more experienced, something I&apos;m
quite happy about.</p>

<p>Most of the remainder of the day was spent in some simple
cooperation-fostering exercises, like the famous &ldquo;Desert
Survival&rdquo; simulation where a team must decide which items to use
after a plane crash.  Tonight our first homework assignment was to
complete a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which will tomorrow be used in
discussions of different learning styles (I think).</p>

<p>So, I&apos;m excited.  Tired (again), but excited.  If I can get
some good sleep during this orientation week, I think school will be
much more comfortable&mdash;I&apos;m just not sure that will
happen.</p>
