            Wow.  Earlier I was wondering if today&#39;s note would be the typical
&ldquo;nothing important happened today;  here&#39;s a movie review&rdquo;
entry.  Turns out no.

<p>The Big Sib/Little Sib barbecue was today, in which those of us fortunate
enough to have survived year 1 of med school are paired with someone fortunate
enough to be just entering it.  As it turns out, my &ldquo;little&rdquo; sib
is <a href="http://packers.com/team/players/michels_john/">John Michels</a>,
former tackle for the <a href="http://www.packers.com">Green Bay Packers</a>.
John really seems like a very cool guy, but I imagine he&#39;ll appreciate it
when people stop approaching him with the obvious celebrity questions.  I
could be wrong, of course&mdash;he must be used to it by now.</p>

<p>Heard an interesting ad on the radio this afternoon for SBC.  Since <a
href="http://www.att.com">AT&amp;T</a> has <a
href="http://www.att.com/news/item/0,1847,13163,00.html">chosen to stop
investing in consumer services</a>, SBC has chosen to take the opportunity
to remind its customers that it won&#39;t forget who got it where it is, and
will always treasure its customers.  In my experience, of course, that means
ignoring service appointments, refusing to answer straightforward questions
(real doozies like &ldquo;What&#39;s your last name?&rdquo;), transferring
calls to other representatives without any communication to you or the other
representative, and making changes to your service without asking.  (I&#39;d
like to say this is why I&#39;m now using <a
href="http://www.speakeasy.net">Speakeasy</a> DSL, but I probably would be
even if SBC weren&#39;t this bad.)  So why do I keep them for long distance?
Very simple.  The last problem I had, at my third request, was escalated to
allow me to speak to a manager.  His name was John Stevenson (of course, this
was by phone, so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s spelled correctly), and he
was nice enough to give me his direct line phone number for the next time
I had a problem.  I&#39;m sure John would like me to pass along his number for
any other complaints or service requests, in the hopes that it will allow
SBC to keep more customers:  it&#39;s (626)304-1735.  I&#39;m not sure this
is useful outside the Pasadena/North Los Angeles area, but feel free to give
it a try.</p>

<p>And a final note of good news&mdash;I&#39;ve been selected for the <a
href="http://www.ama-assn.org">American Medical Association</a> <a
href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/14.html">Medical Student
Section</a>&#39;s Computers and
Technology Committee (no, as of this writing, the CTC Members
page hasn&#39;t been updated yet, but trust me on this one).  It&#39;s
responsibilities range from working on the web site to reporting on
issues in medical computing and technology to implementing systems to aid
in general business (one of our first goals is likely to be an electronic
voting system for the AMA-MSS assemblies).  Good little resume booster, sure,
but something I actually care about, and can hopefully contribute to in some
tiny manner.</p>

<p>So, yeah, big day.  And of course I didn&#39;t get any studying done.</p>
