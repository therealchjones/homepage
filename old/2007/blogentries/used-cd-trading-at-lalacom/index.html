            I like music.  I&#39;m not &ldquo;into&rdquo; music, paying attention to upcoming releases and going to concerts regularly, hearing about new indie bands or discovering new stuff just for fun, but I know what I like, and I&#39;m happy listening to it over and over again.  I spend far too much time adding metadata to my <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> tracks, making mixes, and so forth, but have neither the time nor the money to spend on all those things people do when they are really &ldquo;into&rdquo; music.

<p>I have no moral objections to downloading music for free from peer-to-peer networks, but it, not too long ago, became increasingly difficult to do so with any sort of assurance I wasn&#39;t just downloading noise.  iTunes actually has been reasonable, with its 99 cents per track standard, but&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;there&#39;s still a <em>lot</em> of music I haven&#39;t been able to find there.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://lala.com/">lala.com</a>, the Internet&#39;s used CD store.  It&#39;s actually just a digital infrastructure for trading used CDs between owners;  they send you mailers and take $1.50 per trade (from the person receiving the CD), and you build up karma by trading your own away for free.  I just got my first two CDs today (Add It Up by Violent Femmes and Third Eye Blind by, well, Third Eye Blind), music I know well but don&#39;t mind paying a buck fifty for&mdash;for the entire CD, often with liner notes and all.</p>

<p>Join up.  Trading CDs is entirely legal, safer on the quality side, and a decent amount of fun in the community.</p>
