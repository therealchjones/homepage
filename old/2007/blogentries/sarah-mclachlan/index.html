            &hellip;live, and in concert.  One of Lindsey&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day gifts
 was tickets to tonight&#39;s show at the Staples Center.  Not bad&mdash;not really my kind of music (think more <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:s7d3vw9va9uk">Styx</a> and power ballads), but entertaining, even
if only for making fun of the opening act (who seriously sounded like she was singing &ldquo;Indiana Jones Don&#39;t Cry&rdquo; at one point).  Note to <a href="http://www.butterflyboucher.com">Butterfly Boucher</a>:  angry chick music doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re ugly.  It&#39;s impressive if <a href="http://www.anidifranco.com">Ani DiFranco</a> thinks men are scum, since she could probably get
 anything she wants from them.  It&#39;s just depressing for this opener to think so, though, just because she can&#39;t get a date.

<p>The most amusing highlight of the evening, though, came from one of the beverage &amp; snack vendors.  As if there were a Laker game going on, before (and occasionally even during) the show, referee-striped men were hawking their wares.
 We were there fairly early, so we got to hear plenty of &ldquo;Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi!  Get your caramel corn!&rdquo; from these guys.  When one of them sold a &ldquo;bouquet&rdquo; of caramel corn to a couple of girls a few seats away from us, he chatted with us&mdash;we commiserated the fact that they didn&#39;t sell Cracker Jack at the Staples center, and he complained about hawking peanuts at aMelissa Ethridge concert:  &ldquo;Do you know how hard it is to sell salted nuts
 to a bunch of lesbians?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll just leave you with that thought.</p>
