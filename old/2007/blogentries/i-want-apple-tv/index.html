            Well, kind of.  I want what <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">this device</a> <em>could</em> be.  There&#39;s been speculation since the device was announced (although somewhat less so since it was launched) that it doesn&#39;t have the features &ldquo;everybody wants&rdquo;, like a DVD player, the ability to buy directly from your TV screen, and the ability to stream pictures from more than one computer.  In fact, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">TUAW</a>, just today, had an article asking <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/05/31/is-the-apple-tv-a-dud/">Is the Apple TV a Dud?</a>.

<p>It turns out <a href="http://www.awkwardtv.org/">the machine is very hackable</a>, being essentially a lower-end Intel Mac.  This makes it tempting all by itself.  Further, I get that Apple&#39;s not trying to make this an all-encompassing home media center;  there&#39;s really no need to include a DVR (okay, minimal need) or a DVD player, since all of the content available for such is quickly available online (in legal or semi-legal form) or via ripping your own DVDs (again, legal or semi-legal).  I&#39;d be perfectly happy with this little box&mdash;indeed, I&#39;d have purchased one long ago&mdash;if only for a couple features which still aren&#39;t available, and without which I&#39;m extremely unlikely to purchase any such device:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Play just about any format I throw at it</dt>
<dd>An open source program, <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> will play
nearly any file I download on a Mac.  It&#39;s not without its problems (mainly user-interface-related), but plays VOBs, AVIs, and so forth remarkably well, requiring no degradation of quality just to get a movie into a &ldquo;supported&rdquo; iTunes format.  Unfortunately, there&#39;s still no &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; available for Apple TV (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row">Front Row</a>) to enable video to be played in anything other than a QuickTime-equivalent player;  and in fact, due to the iTunes business model, Apple has very little motivation for coming up with such a thing.  It would be nice, though, if one of the many hacks for Apple TV changed this (and <em>only</em> this&mdash;the Front Row interface itself is excellent).</dd>
<dt>Show higher-resolution video</dt>
<dd>This is likely only a processor-power issue, something which can easily be corrected in the next iteration of Apple TV (if there is one).  Again, though, this is unlikely to happen without higher-resolution video files, something people have been clamoring for from iTunes.  Personally, I&#39;d be happy enough just to play the files I currently have (the aforementioned downloads and DVD rips) in their higher resolution.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Yup, those two.  Apple could have my $300 (or even $400 or $500, maybe more) if they added in just those two things.  In the meantime, I&#39;ll greedily wait for someone else to do it, and somewhat less greedily spend the time I can on making a replacement myself.  Don&#39;t hold your breath, but I really am working on it.</p>
