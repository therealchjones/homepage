            So, as I started to mention in my last post, I&apos;m 
experiencing a sense of rejuvenated interest, formed 
consciously to combat, if nothing else, creeping apathy and
frustration that may better be described as &ldquo;pouncing&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;creeping&rdquo;.  Yes, it may be a bit
forced, but it&apos;s actually quite effective so far.  When
I don&apos;t get something right, I&apos;m not as upset and
I&apos;m more likely to see it as a &ldquo;learning 
issue&rdquo; rather than as a failure.  When I do get 
something right, it delights me.  I&apos;m excited about 
almost everything involved with medical school right now,
probably for the first time in months.

<p>In a spirit of serendipity, I also got an email from my
Salerni Collegium mentor (well, his assistant).  Salerni
is an interesting cocurricular organization that does everything
from establishing a clinician mentorship program for students to
writing an unofficial orientation guide for MSIs to providing
free football tickets and barbecue for the <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/">USC</a> homecoming game.  My assigned
mentor, as luck would have it, is the chair of the primary 
trauma surgery team;  I&apos;m very excited to meet him this
afternoon and find out about shadowing opportunities&mdash;not
to mention just make some connections.  It seems hopeful that
my rejuvenated interest will carry over into career as well.</p>

<p>It&apos;s also working great for home stuff.  Lindsey&apos;s 
working hard in preparation for next week&apos;s <a
href="http://www.soa.org/eande/fall03_catalog/fall03_course1.html">actuarial
exam</a>, an extremely difficult test at the undergrad level, which
still takes a great deal of preparation even for someone with
Lindsey&apos;s background.  She&apos;s doing well in preparation,
but it&apos;s quite stressful for her and admittedly boring around the 
house for me.  However, thanks to rejuvenated interest, I&apos;m
spending time on my Linux distribution, learning introductory Spanish,
and trying to go through the Mega Memory program.</p>

<p>I realize I&apos;ve never mentioned my performance on the 
exams from a couple weeks ago.  I did quite well, certainly passing
everything, and even excelling in a few areas.  There were also a few
areas in which I scored below the mean (biochemistry comes to mind), but
well within the two-standard-deviation cutoff that suggests more serious
problems.  Thanks to a lack of preparation (I think), I did score
slightly outside that range in microanatomy&mdash;still most
certainly passing, but certainly not as well as I&apos;d like.  I
asked to do an informal review with the chair of the microanatomy course,
who also happens to be important in the selection of Dean&apos;s
Recognition and is on the curriculum committee.  He suggested that
since the school has the funds anyway, they pay a third year for a
few hours of microanatomy/pathology integration tutoring.  I&apos;m
sure it will be helpful&mdash;it might even be more advantageous than
trying to study it on my own.  I&apos;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve just started to get into the abdomen in gross anatomy;  
I&apos;m certain today will be somewhat malodorous (isn&apos;t that
a great word?).  I just hope my rejuvenated interest keeps me from
getting sick&hellip;.</p>
