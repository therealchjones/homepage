            Eli&#39;s coming, hide your heart, girl.

<p>No, not the inveterate womanizer, but my stint on Thoracic Foregut Surgery at USC&#39;s University Hospital.  It&#39;s got a reputation for being a rather difficult service, and nearly every surgeon-to-be has to rotate through it for the experience and the possibility of earning a letter of recommendation from the school&#39;s Chair of the Department of Surgery.  I&#39;ve just gotten off the phone with one of my colleagues who&#39;s just finished the service, who was happy to give me some tips.  For better or worse, a large portion of his tips involved working hard for long hours.</p>

<p>For instance, the typical day seems to be about 0400 to 2100 or 2200.  That&#39;s long, 1700-1800 if my math is right.  Plus call once a week.  That&#39;s fine, I can deal with long hours, and they actually go by more quickly if I&#39;m working hard, but I will have to make some sacrifices.</p>

<p>Clearly the biggest of these is the general lack of time at home.  Television, cuddling, and hobbies just have to take a backseat, unfortunately.  Those hobbies include computing and blogging, so I&#39;m officially putting network plans and other upgrades on hiatus.  I may have minimal time to work on them on weekends, but have a feeling it may be (at least) another 4 weeks before I make another entry here or do much else computer-related.</p>

<p>Since that&#39;s the case, there are some specifics I need to finish up today, like reinstalling Windows on my PC laptop, making some DVD's for Lindsey to watch, and so forth.  Not to mention, of course, physically and mentally preparing for tomorrow.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be back.  Eventually.</p>
