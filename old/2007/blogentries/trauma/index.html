            &hellip;trauma surgery, that is.  So I met with Juan Asensio, my
mentor for the Salerni Mentor program, and unit chief of trauma
surgery service A at County.  He&apos;s an incredibly active guy (a
quick Medline search shows well over a hundred articles by him), and
seems to advise people all over the world.  If I can just get beyond
the whole lack of time at home, trauma surgery could seem like a very
reasonable career choice.

<p>So what happenned to that whole thing about putting off any real
career decisions as long as possible?  Just another side effect of
rejuvenated interest, my friend.  The main reasons I decided to delay
any such decisions had to do with the lack of interest I was feeling
for any of the things I had thought I would enjoy.  However, with all
my rejuvenated interest, I&apos;m happy to be entertaining plenty of
thoughts of career and future directions.</p>

<p>I do, however, have to continue to concentrate on the present.  For
instance, I need to review eleven immunology lectures this weekend.  I
suppose I should get to it&hellip;</p>
