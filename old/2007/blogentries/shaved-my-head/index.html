            Yup, I did it.  Went whole hog.  Partly for utilitarian reasons, and partly for <a
href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/2005/11/worst-haircut-ever.html">my feelings on
SuperCuts</a>.  Totally bald, probably for the next few days, anyway.  Luckily, I&#39;m not alone:  there are great role models in shaved heads to emulate.

<dl>
<dt>Kojak</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/kojak-777538.png"><img src="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/kojak-765617.png" alt="Kojak's Head" /></a> Kojak, quite possibly the most recognizable shaved head of my parent&#39;s generation, fighting crime and looking good while doing it.</dd>

<dt>Lex Luthor</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/luthor-720459.png"><img src="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/luthor-716895.png" alt="Lex Luthor's Head" /></a> Lex Luthor, quite possibly the most villainous and brilliant shaved head ever.  Who else could mastermind a scheme to steal fractions of cents?</dd>

<dt>Jared Svenning</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/svenning-737489.png"><img src="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/svenning-730572.png" alt="Mr. Svenning's Head" /></a> Mr. Svenning, quite possibly the most recognizable shave head to anyone who went to college in the late 1990's.  <a href="http://www.viewaskew.com/mallrats/">Mallrats</a> may have been a flop, but it&#39;s more than made up for it in geek rentals from the video store.</dd>

<dt>Jesse Ventura</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/ventura-721274.png"><img src="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/ventura-711140.png" alt="Jesse Ventura's Head" /></a> Jesse Ventura, quite possibly just as fictional as the above shaved heads, and the first cast member of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/">Predator</a> to become governor of one of the United States.</dd>

<dt>His Holiness the Dalai Lama</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/lama-729153.png"><img src="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/uploaded_images/lama-723481.png" alt="His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Head" /></a> The Dalai Lama, the present incarnation of Avalokitesvara, quite possibly the most impressive shaved head ever.  Personally, I'd like to attain enlightenment myself&mdash;I hear it comes with a pretty nice certificate, suitable for framing.</dd>

<p>Want to join this illustrious group?  It&#39;s not difficult, but it is more so than I'd expected;  it definitely helps to have a hand with the back of your head.  Don&#39;t wish to join, but want to show respect and tolerance?  For the sake of politeness, always note how much you like the new look&mdash;there&#39;s not much the wearer can do about it.  Factual notes, like &ldquo;you shaved your head&rdquo; aren&#39;t really rude, but aren&#39;t particularly helpful.  Saying &ldquo;you look like a walking penis&rdquo; is right out.</p>
