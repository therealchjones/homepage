            &hellip;to lose 100 pounds in one year.  Admittedly, I&apos;m only
30 pounds into it, but it&apos;s going well.  The goal is to be at
175.5 by April 24;  I&apos;ll keep you updated over the next seven
months.

<p>I&apos;m also on track to graduate from medical school.  We had our
first practice test on Wednesday, and I did fine.  I didn&apos;t ace
it or anything, and I haven&apos;t been doing what you might call
&ldquo;studying&rdquo;, but I&apos;ve been doing good for me at least.
I&apos;ve essentially halted a lot of extracurricular activities (like
tagging along in the Emergency Room), partly out of time constraints
and partly out of frustration.  The last shadowing I did was very
disappointing, and I don&apos;t need to be disappointed in my career
choice just yet.  Essentially, I&apos;ve decided that everyone does
the same work for the first two years of medical school (and maybe
longer); there&apos;s no reason I have to (or should) worry about a
specialty just now.  Add to that the fact that I can&apos;t even
choose between medicine and surgery&mdash;so why worry.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve completed the very first incarnation of what I&apos;m
calling (for now, at least) InFiniT GNU/Linux.  That is, I have a
completely bootable system made from scratch, and the idea is to put
it onto a live CD-ROM and make the installation process a couple hours
of compiling in front of you.  Don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll do any
sort of &ldquo;release&rdquo; on here, and it&apos;s not exactly the
sexiest distribution (you might think of it as a minimal&mdash;very
minimal&mdash; development environment), but I&apos;ll arrange that
sometime.  Nice to have a hobby outside medicine.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing&mdash;it&apos;s premier week!</p>
