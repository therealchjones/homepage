<p>No, that&#39;s not me, and not a patient I&#39;ve seen over the last few weeks on
my psychiatry rotation, but it is a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12425803/">man who tried to commit suicide with a nailgun</a>, and then reported to an emergency department complaining of a headache.  Like far too many patients I&#39;ve been seeing lately, he was a heavy crystal meth user and had little if any idea what he was doing.</p>

<p>Yup, it&#39;s mostly my psychiatry rotation&mdash;six weeks in <a href="http://www.lacusc.org/">LAC+USC Medical Center</a>&#39;s psychiatric emergency room&mdash;that&#39;s kept me from making a post in over a month.  It&#39;s been interesting, just a bit time-consuming.  There are a few things I&#39;ve noticed in the last week, however, hence this Round-up.  More meaningful commentary and personal stories can wait.</p>

<p>Turns out that there will be some real shake-ups in the next Star Trek movie.  It&#39;s been a ridiculously long time since I&#39;ve watched any Trek, but I was still amused to find that the <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117941815?categoryid=10&amp;cs=1&amp;s=h&amp;p=0">production team from <span class="longtitle">Lost</span> will make the next Star Trek flick</a>.  Also turns out this one will be a bit different&mdash;it will follow Kirk and Spock as young men in school and on their first mission.  <span class="longtitle">Trek</span> meets <span class="longtitle">Lost</span> meets <span class="longtitle">The O.C.</span>?  What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="http://news.com.com/Gonzales+calls+for+mandatory+Web+labeling+law/2100-1028_3-6063554.html">government is again trying to mandate web self-ratings</a>.  Hey, I&#39;m all for putting an &ldquo;explicit lyrics&rdquo; tag on this site;  it might get rid of the need for that <a href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a> I have linked at the top of the page.  But why on earth would anyone think that would solve the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of children looking at &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; material, or especially the real problem of people trying to prey on the young and naive?  I&#39;m seriously doubting the possibility of anyone putting a warning on their teeny-bopper site along the lines of &ldquo;I&#39m actually a 40-year-old pot-bellied bald man who likes luring prepubescent girls&rdquo;.  Still, maybe that explicit lyrics tag for this site might not be a bad idea&hellip;.</p>
