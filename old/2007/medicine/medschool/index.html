<p><strong>Please note that I haven&#39;t updated the below page(s) in

is to refrain from holding your breath.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m a medical student at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/ksom.html">Keck School of Medicine</a> at the
<a href="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>, so I can&#39;t afford to spend a great deal of time on my
web page anymore, unfortunately.  I still spend it, I just can&#39;t really afford to.  Until I can, please don&#39;t 
complain that I&#39;m not spending more.  I might cry.  Instead of complaining, find the link you&#39;re looking for below.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve added a very small bit of <a href="computing.html">information on
USC computing</a> that&#39;s marginally relevant here.  Really just a
ready-reference for network addresses, VPN settings, and such, but useful for
looking up instead of trying to find my way around the <a
href="http://www.usc.edu/isd/help/">USC ISD Help pages</a>.  Also a bit
of info on using Gmail instead of the less-than-spectacular USC Email
service.</p>
