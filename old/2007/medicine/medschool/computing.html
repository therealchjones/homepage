<h2>USC Student Network Info (for &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; users)</h2>

<p>The USC network requires certain settings in order to connect properly, 
including proper connection to a Cisco 3000 VPN concentrator. The below is 
intended to be a quick guide to the steps necessary to connect to the USC 
network, either wirelessly via an 802.11b adapter on the USC campus or 
via a home computer. All the below information is publicly available; you 
still need a USC account in order to fully connect, and a USC-registered 
MAC address to connect at all. (Your MAC can be registered at the <a 
href="https://secweb.usc.edu/isd/nwdbmod/mod/wirelessregister.tmpl">USC
network card registration</a> page.</p>

<p>(Most of this information is simply copied from <a
href="http://medweb.usc.edu/tech_help/advanced_notes">MedWeb&#39;s
Notes for Advanced Users</a>.)</p>

<h2>Using <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> instead of USC 
Email</h2>

<p><a href="https://email.usc.edu/">USC Email</a> sucks.  The storage space
is very limited, especially for all those attachments people like to send
the med school class, and mail older than 180 days is routinely 
deleted&mdash;even if it&#39;s stored in folders other than the Inbox.
<a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, however, is a <em>huge</em>
step up;  in fact, a real step up from any other web-based mail.</p>

<p>A few of my friends have been switching to Gmail, so I started giving
them advice on how to do so effectively.  The below guide allows you to
use Gmail instead of USC for all your needs, allows you to check only 
Gmail and avoid the USC Web Mail interface, and makes sure you still 
don&#39;t miss any med school announcements by nicely labelling all the
ones that were supposed to go to that account.</p>

<p>(By the way:  don&#39;t have a Gmail account?  For the moment, it&#39;s
invitation-only, but I have plenty of invitations to give out.  <a
href="mailto:chjones@aleph0.com">Email me</a> and I&#39;ll be happy to
send you one.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Log onto Gmail first.  On the left, under &ldquo;Labels&rdquo;, 
click on &ldquo;Edit Labels&rdquo;.  In the &ldquo;Create a new 
label&rdquo; box, enter &ldquo;Med School&rdquo; (or whatever) and click 
on &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</li>

<li><p>Next, next to the search box at the top of the screen is &ldquo;Create a
filter&rdquo;.  Click on it, and in the &ldquo;To:&rdquo; box, enter 
&ldquo;usc.edu&rdquo;.  (This way, it&#39;ll catch things sent directly 
to you as well as to <code>med2007</code> or other aliases at USC.)  
Click on the &ldquo;Next Step&rdquo; button.  From the &ldquo;Apply the 
label (Choose Label&hellip;)&rdquo; menu, choose &ldquo;Med 
School&rdquo;, and make sure the box is checked.  Click on &ldquo;Create 
Filter&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(At this point, any mail coming in with &ldquo;usc.edu&ldquo; in the 
To, CC, or BCC fields will automatically have the label &ldquo;Med 
School&rdquo; added, so when it&#39;s in your inbox there will be little 
green text on the conversation that says &ldquo;Med 
School&rdquo;&mdash;it&#39;ll be nice and obvious and make searching a 
little easier.  For instance, suppose I wanted to look for an email that 
Forman sent the class:  I could enter in the search box:</p>

<pre>
from:forman label:"med school"
</pre>

<p>Though that may be a stupid example.)</p></li>

<li>To forward everything from your USC account so you don&#39;t have to
check in two places, log into <a href="https://email.usc.edu">USC Web 
Mail</a>.  Near the top, click on &ldquo;Options&rdquo;, and then to the 
left click on &ldquo;Settings&rdquo;.  In the bottom box, enter your Gmail
address (such as <code>yourmomma@gmail.com</code>).  To activate 
the forwarding, check the &ldquo;Enable forwarding&rdquo; box.  I prefer 
for everything to be in gmail&mdash;I don&#39;t have any messages at all 
on my USC account.  If you&ldquo;d like it that way, also check the 
&ldquo;Don&#39;t leave copy on server&rdquo; box.  Click &ldquo;Save 
Changes&rdquo;, and never deal with the USC webmail again!  (Except to
change your password regularly, of course.)  (Also note that if you 
<em>didn&#39;t</em> check the &ldquo;Don&#39;t leave copy on server&rdquo;
box, you may have to clear out your inbox from time to time&mdash;I&#39;d
strongly recommend checking the box.)</li>
