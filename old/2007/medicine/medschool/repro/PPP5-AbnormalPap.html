<div id="history">
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A 38-year-old G8P4Ab4 woman received notice that the resolut of her Pap test
three weeks prior was abnormal.  She had gone to a gynecologist at the
insistence of a close friend.  Her last Pap test had been eight years prior,
at the time of her last pregnancy.  She had undergone a postpartum tubal 
sterilization and had not seen a gynecologist since.</p>
<p>Her Pap test showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
(ASC-US).</p>
<h3>Past Medical History</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smoker since age 13 (1 PPD)</li>
<li>First full term pregnancy delivery age 18</li>
<li>Gestational diabetes during her 3rd pregnancy and with each succeeding
pregnancy</li>
<li>Coitarche age 15 with ~12 lifetime sexual partners</li>
<li>No history of alcohol or drug abuse or sexually transmitted diseases</li>
</ul>
<h3>Past Surgical History</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy age 4</li>
<li>Appendectomy age 23</li>
<li>Tubal ligation age 30</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pertinent Physical Examination Findings</h3>
<p>Completely normal, including well-healed infraumbilical and right lower
quadrant abdominal scars</p>

<h2>Discussion Points/Questions</h2>
<dl>
<dt>What possible disease entities could be responsible for this patient&#39;s
abnormality on pap?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Minor cervical cell changes found during a Pap test may be caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infection, including infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV)</li>
<li>Inflammation of cervical cells</li>
<li>&ldquo;precancerous&rdquo; changes</li>
<li>Idiopathic, or unknown changes</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>How would you proceed with the evaluation/management of this patient&#39;s
abnormality?</dt>

<dd>
<p>ASC-US abnormalities may be followed with &ldquo;watchful 
waiting&rdquo;.  (But then, really, what can&#39;t?)  An HPV test, either on
the available Pap test or on a new sample, may be warranted to assess any
additional risk of cervical cancer.  The NIH Consensus statement<sup><a 
href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> suggests that <q>the patient in question 
must undergo thorough diagnostic evaluation</q>, specifically:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ideally, diagnostic evaluation should include colposcopic 
examination and biopsies of representative areas of the cervix usually 
including an endocervical curettage (scraping of the interior wall of the 
cervix). Diagnostic conization of the cervix (removal of a cone of tissue) 
may also be required if the location of the lesion makes colposcopy 
unsatisfactory, if the diagnosis from an endocervical curettage so indicates, 
or if the cytologic and histologic findings conflict.</p></blockquote>
</dd>

<dt>Is there more than one acceptable management?  Which one would you pick?
Why?</dt>

<dd>
<p>The above two choices (&ldquo;watchful waiting&rdquo; versus &ldquo;thorough
evaluation&rdquo;) represent two extremes.  It may (or may not) be beneficial
to discover neoplasia in a very early stage, but this must be weighed against
the risks of minor surgery (as in cervical biopsy), patient discomfort and 
anxiety, and the continued chance of false positives in these tests.</p>

<p>It is almost certainly safe to perform <em>only</em> the minimally-invasive
colposcopy (that is, &ldquo;minimally-invasive&rdquo; relative to biopsy, 
curettage, or conization).  Discovery of grossly abnormal areas suggests the
need for biopsy, whereas lack of gross changes is less likely to be associated
with higher-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias.  Assuming a lack of
gross abnormalities, it is likely to be safe to repeat the Pap smear in six
months to one year.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Is this patient at increased risk for developing cervical cancer?  What
would be this risk?  What is the etiology of cervical cancer precursor 
lesions?</dt>
<dd>
<p>More than 60% of ASC-US changes go away on their own.  5-10% of all Pap 
tests result in a diagnosis of ASC-US.  Approximately 10-15% of women with a
cytologic result of ASC-US will have biopsy-confirmed CIN-2 or CIN-3, which is
more likely to progress to cervical carcinoma or persist as CIN than to 
regress.  Still, only 22% of CIN-2 progresses (to either invasive cervical 
cancer or carcinoma <span class="foreign">in situ</span>/CIN-3), and 14% of 
CIN-3 progresses.  In all, the majority of invasive cancers occur now in women 
who have not been screened at all, rather than in those screened too 
infrequently.</p>

<p>That, of course, refers to the general population.  This patient&#39;s risk
may be somewhat higher, due to her history of smoking, multiple partners, and
multiple births.  Specific risk factors for CIN include sexual activity at an 
early age, history of sexually transmitted infections, multiple sexual 
partners, or engaging in sexual activity with promiscuous men. These data 
firmly implicate a venereally transmitted agent as a major causal factor: 
this agent is infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). In fact, the 
association between HPV and cervical neoplasia has proven so strong that 
most other behavioral, sexual, and socioeconomic covariables are found to be 
dependent upon HPV infection and do not hold up as independent risk 
factors.  The association of some types of HPV infection and the development
of CIN and/or cervical cancer has been consistently supported by studies such
that the infection is considered necessary (though not sufficient) for 
development of cervical cancer.  The mechanism by which certain subtypes of
HPV cause CIN is unclear.</p>

<p>Other consistently reported risk factors include cigarette smoking, 
muliparity, and immunodeficiency.  Some weak risk association has been found in 
oral contraceptive use and certain dietary deficiencies.</p>

</dd>
<dt>At the time of the case discussion, you will be presented with a pathologic
diagnosis and images that correspond to it (you will not be asked to make the
diagnosis).  Be prepared to discuss the management of common cervical cancer
precursor lesions.</dt>
<dd>Okay.  You may want to refer to the <a
