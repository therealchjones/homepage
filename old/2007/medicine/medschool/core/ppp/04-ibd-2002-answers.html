<p class="question">What is known today about the etiology of IBD
(environmental factors, diet, etc.)?</p>
<p><strong>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD)
constitute the two major idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBDs).</strong> Clinicians now recognize that there is a spectrum
of IBDs, encompassing various types and degrees of intestinal
inflammation that must be distinguished from inflammation caused by
infections, drugs, ischemia, and radiation. UC and CD are the most
common and best understood of these idiopathic diseases; their
etiologies, however, remain elusive.</p>
<p>Epidemiology: <strong>UC and CD share most epidemiologic
characteristics. These diseases are relatively common in developed
countries and infrequent in countries with poor sanitation. In
North America and Europe, the incidence is approximately 100 per
100,000 population. The diseases can affect persons of any age, but
they are most common in the second and third decades. Males and
females are affected equally. No dietary factor has been identified
as yet, although case-control studies suggest an association with
the ingestion of large amounts of unrefined sugar and possibly with
unsaturated fats (essentially, the Western diet).</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Etiology</span>:
<strong>No single etiologic infectious agent has been associated
with UC or CD. In recent years, a chronic measles-like viral
infection, infection with Listeria monocytogenes, and infection
with atypical mycobacteria have been hypothetically linked to CD
without sufficient confirmation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are two major etiologic clues. The first is the
primary familial association of IBD, which suggests a genetic
predisposition.</strong> Once a proband has been identified, risk
of disease occurring in a second family member is approximately 20%
(40% if the proband is a child.</p>
<p><strong>The second etiologic clue is the relation between
cigarette smoking and UC and CD. Cigarette smoking is known to
decrease the risk of UC; however, smoking is strongly associated
with CD. Cigarette smoking also influences the course of
IBD.</strong> Ex-smokers with UC are more likely to have refractory
disease and to require surgery than are patients who smoke and
those who have never smoked. Conversely, cigarette smokers with CD
are more likely to have disease that is refractory to medical
therapy. In cigarette smokers, CD often recurs more rapidly after
surgical resection than in nonsmokers. It has not been established
that nicotine is the primary factor in the opposite associations of
cigarette smoking with UC and CD. Nicotine (as delivered by a
patch) appears to have a modest ameliorative effect in UC, although
not as potent an effect as that provided by cigarette smoking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="question">What are the basic factors that mediate immune
response in IBD?</p>
<p><strong>Immune response in IBD is not fully understood; there is
humoral-, cell-mediated immunity, cytokine immunity&mdash;as well
as environmental, genetic, microbial factors.</strong></p>

<p class="question">What are the similarities and differences in
clinical symptoms and signs in Crohn disease vs ulcerative colitis?
The inflammation is usually mucosal in ulcerative colitis but
transmural in Crohn disease. How does this help to explain some of
the clinical findings?</p>
<p><strong>Since the inflammation in Crohn disease extends through
the full thickness of the bowel wall to involve the serosa, deep
fissure ulcers can develop. Further development of these ulcers can
lead to adhesions and the formation of a fistula tract connecting
with other structures such as an adjoining loop of intestine,
bladder, vagina, or perianal skin. Abscess formation may also
result. Less commonly there may be perforation. Also as a result of
the transmural inflammation, fibrosis of the bowel wall occurs
which can produce fibrosing strictures and possible obstruction of
the small bowel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation is typically
confined to the mucosa and the serosa is usually unaffected. Thus
one does not usually see fissure ulcers, fistulas, adhesions,
perianal or other abscesses, mural thickening, strictures, or
obstruction in ulcerative colitis or the clinical complications
resulting from them.</strong></p>

<p class="question">What is the prognosis and the basic treatment
options for patients with IBD?</p>
<blockquote cite="#hanauer">
<p>The treatment of UC and CD is based on the location, extent, and
severity of disease as well as on the prior response to therapy.
<strong>Factors contributing to exacerbations of activity or
refractoriness to therapy should be sought. These factors include
concomitant medications (e.g., NSAIDs, antibiotics), intercurrent
infections (e.g., C. difficile), changes in menstruation, and
changes in diet or lifestyle (including changes in smoking habits).
There are more similarities than differences in the treatment of UC
and CD; however, those differences are vital.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Irritable bowel syndrome is common in the general
population and is equally prevalent in patients with IBD. A dietary
history is important in identifying aggravating foods contributing
to digestive symptoms. Approximately one half of patients with IBD
receive complementary therapies.</strong> (A careful review of the
patient's use of vitamins, health foods, fiber, homeopathic agents,
and herbs may help identify factors contributing to changes in
bowel habits. Many patients with IBD suffer from concurrent
irritable bowel syndrome. Although the usual stress of daily living
does not affect the inflammatory activity of IBD, many patients
report that stress precedes a worsening of symptoms.
<strong>Antispasmodics, primarily anticholinergic agents (e.g.,
dicyclomine, clidinium bromide, hyoscyamine, propantheline, and
belladonna alkaloids), treat cramping abdominal discomfort or
symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome accompanying UC and
CD.</strong> Similarly, antidiarrheal preparations (e.g.,
diphenoxylate, loperamide, and codeine) can be used to reduce the
frequency of bowel movements and rectal urgency in patients with
mild to moderate UC and CD. Antimotility agents should be avoided
in severe or fulminant disease because of the risk of inducing
toxic megacolon (<a href="#hanauer">Hanauer</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="#schrier">
<p>The general measures to control the symptoms of both diseases
include correction of fluid--electrolyte imbalances, iron, folate,
or vitamin B 12 supplementation as needed for the treatment of
anemia; and dietary adjustments aimed at maintaining adequate
nutrition. Total parenteral nutrition may be required for the
short-term treatment of severe acute disease, but "bowel rest" and
hyperalimentation are of dubious value in the long term.</p>
<p><strong>In Ulcerative Colitis, corticosteroids are useful for
inducing remissions or improvement in an acute attack, and they may
be required for long-term management. However, the possible
benefits of corticosteroids in the long term are offset by their
many adverse side effects. Sulfasalazine is metabolized by colonic
bacteria, releasing sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA);
the latter is believed to be the active compound. Sulfapyridine is
absorbed systemically, which accounts for the side effects of
sulfasalazine (e.g., headache, occasional megaloblastic anemia,
skin rash)&hellip;.</strong> Because the relative risk for
development of ulcerative colitis is greater in nonsmokers than in
smokers (the opposite is true in Crohn disease), nicotine is being
tried in the treatment of ulcerative colitis; some benefit has been
reported, but additional research is needed.</p>
<p><strong>There is no uniformly effective treatment available for
Crohn disease. However, corticosteroids have documented efficacy in
diminishing the activity of the disease process. Sulfasalazine has
some effectiveness, especially in colonic Crohn disease, but is
less effective than corticosteroids. Metronidazole may be at least
as effective as sulfasalazine.</strong> When Crohn disease cannot
be controlled by these medications, the immunosuppressive agent
azathioprine and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine are sometimes
tried; their use can result in a reduction in the corticosteroid
dose needed, but this advantage may be offset by their toxic
effects (<a href="#schrier">Schrier</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="#rubin">
<p><strong>Patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease have
recurrent relapses and remissions throughout their lives. Patients
with ulcerative proctitis have symptoms that are a nuisance but are
easily managed. With proctitis alone, there is no risk of
life-threatening complications or future development of malignancy.
Patients with diffuse colitis have a more debilitating illness, but
modern therapy is successful and there is no excess mortality over
that of the general population. A total proctocolectomy cures
ulcerative colitis. This operative procedure is generally
recommended only (1) for patients with disease unresponsive to
medical therapy and (2) in long-standing disease to prevent the
development of malignancy. Patients with Crohn disease have a
higher mortality rate than that of either the general population or
patients with ulcerative colitis. (<a href=
