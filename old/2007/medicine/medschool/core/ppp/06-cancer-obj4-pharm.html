<h1>PPP #6: Breast Cancer</h1>

<h2>Objective 4:  Describe the types of pharmaceutical treatements
used in breast cancer including explanation of which treatements
should be used for each of the different stages of breast cancer.</h2>

<p>According to Harrison&apos;s, &ldquo;There is no justification for
adjuvant chemotherapy in women with tumors &lt;1 cm in size whose
axillary lymph nodes are negative&rdquo; for metastatic signs.  These
&ldquo;Stage 0&rdquo; carcinomas receive no pharmaceutical treatment.
More advanced cases are treated as summarized in <a
href="#table1">Table&nbsp;1</a> and further expounded below.</p>

<p>Tamoxifen is an &ldquo;antiestrogen&rdquo; agent, a form of hormone
therapy, not technically chemotherapy.  Where indicated <a
href="#table1">above</a>, it should usually be administered following
completion of chemotherapy, not concurrently.  It is typically
administered only in those cases with positive ER.</p>

<p>Some survival advantage to chemotherapy has been shown in
postmenopausal women, but the benefits are controversial.  Tamoxifen
in these women improves survival for patients with or without positive
lymph node status, but survival improvement is modest in cases where
multiple lymph nodes are involved.  For this reason, chemotherapy is
often used for patients without contraindications who have more than
one involved lymph node, and tamoxifen is there given simultaneously
or subsequently.  Tamoxifen may be used without chemotherapy in
postmenopausal women with a more positive prognosis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neoadjuvant therapy&rdquo; is more recently being used.
This is adjuvant therapy prior to surgery and radiation;  in up to 75%
of patients, this allows &ldquo;downstaging&rdquo;, often allowing
breast conservation.  At least one randomized study failed to
find any difference in survival.</p>

<p>Nearly half the patients treated for breast cancer develop some
form of metatstatic disease.  The choice of therapy requires
consideration of local therapy needs, the overall medical condition of
the patient, and the hormone receptor status of the tumor, as well as
the exercise of clinical judgment. Because therapy of systemic disease
is palliative, the potential toxicities of therapies should be
balanced against the response rates. Several variables influence the
response to systemic therapy. For example, the presence of estrogen
and progesterone receptors is a strong indication for endocrine
therapy, since the response rates for tumors that express both
receptors may approach 70%. On the other hand, patients with short
disease-free intervals, rapidly progressive visceral disease,
lymphangitic pulmonary disease, or intracranial disease are unlikely
to respond to endocrine therapy.</p>

<p>Unlike many other epithelial malignancies, breast cancer responds to
several chemotherapeutic agents, including anthracyclines, alkylating
agents, taxanes, and antimetabolites. Multiple combinations of these
agents have been found to improve response rates somewhat, but they
have had little impact on duration of response or survival. As
previously mentioned, median survival from diagnosis of metastatic
disease is approximately 2 years. The choice among multidrug
combinations frequently depends on whether adjuvant chemotherapy was
administered and, if so, what type. While patients treated with
adjuvant regimens such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
fluorouracil (CMF regimens) may subsequently respond to the same
combination in the metastatic disease setting, most oncologists use
drugs to which the patients have not been previously exposed. Once
patients have progressed after combination drug therapy, it is most
common to treat them with single agents. Given the significant
toxicity of most drugs, the use of a single effective agent will
minimize toxicity by sparing the patient exposure to drugs that would
be of little value. Unfortunately, no form of in vitro drug
sensitivity testing to select the drugs most efficacious for a given
patient has been demonstrated to be useful.</p>

<p>Most oncologists use either an anthracycline or paclitaxel following
failure with the initial regimen. However, the choice has to be
balanced with individual needs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Locally advanced&rdquo; (Stage III) breast cancer is often
difficult to remove surgically, especially if there is chest wall
involvement.  Although no randomized trials have proved the efficacy
of induction chemotherapy, this approach has gained widespread
use. More than 90% of patients with locally advanced breast cancer
show a partial or better response to multidrug chemotherapy regimens
that include an anthracycline. Early administration of this treatment
reduces the bulk of the disease and frequently makes the patient a
suitable candidate for salvage surgery and/or radiation therapy.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>

<li>For most patients, use a combination of anthracyclines,
antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and taxanes (paclitaxel).</li>

<li>For stage III patients, make sure your combination uses
anthracyclines.</li>

<li>For patients who are positive for ER, add tamoxifen.</li>

<li>For patients with a small surgically removed lump and no other
poor prognostic factors, there is no need for chemotherapy.</li>
