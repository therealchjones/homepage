<h1>PPP Case 2 Objective 5: Major clinical problems of cystic fibrosis, their typical
presentations, and their underlying pathophysiology</h1>

<p>As previously discussed, cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease
caused by improper coding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein.  This protein (among other
things) provides a channel for the chloride ion to pass into and out
of the cell, especially accomodating the passage of chloride through
epithelial cells.  It is mainly the impairment of this action that
provides the most basic causes for the major clinical symptoms of
cystic fibrosis.  In the most problematic clinical symptoms, the
failure of chloride to pass through the epithelia lining the inner
mucous membranes of the body keeps the mucus at a low osmolality;
since chloride does not pass through the epithelia, there is no
concentration gradient to help sodium into the lumen, and the
resulting lack of an osmolality gradient does not help water into the
lumen.  The result is a mucus that is much thicker than normal; this
thick mucous is the secondary cause of the most serious clinical
symptoms.</p>

<p>Typical presentation of CF is quite varied between individuals, and
even varies with age.  Its major clinical problems are manifested in
the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems;  we consider each of
these separately.</p>

<h2>Gastrointestinal presentation</h2>

<p>The pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal disorders of CF
patients is of two varieties.  As mentioned above, both are caused by
a thick mucus resulting from the failure of the CFTR protein.  In the
first case, a thicker mucus lining the intestines causes a more likely
intestinal blockage.  In approximately 10% of CF patients, this is the
first sign of CF, as this blockage (meconium ileus) keeps them from
passing their first stool (a tarry, greenish-black stool called the
meconium and normally passed within 24-48 hours after birth) within
the typical time period.  Especially among younger patients, this
thicker intestinal mucus may lead to intestinal problems from
inflammation to twists in the intestine itself.</p>

<p>Later gastrointestinal problems are mainly of the second variety,
caused by thick mucus blocking the ducts of the pancreas into the
intestines.  This blockage leads to a failure of pancreatic enzymes to
enter the digestive tract.  These enzymes normally digest fats and
proteins; the lack of them therefore leads to chronic malnutrition and
failure to thrive, while also causing excess fat to be expelled in the
stool, leading to characteristic diarrhea or foul-smelling, bulky,
pale, greasy stools that float (steatorrhea).  Patients may also
experience abdominal pain relating to overactive bowels and excess
gas, and often experience other consequences of overactive bowels,
such as hemorrhoids, inflammation of the intestines, dehydration, and
occasional rectal prolapse.  Failure to digest fats also means failure
to intake fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and therefore leads
to associated vitamin deficiency disorders.  Because the pancreas is
blocked, about 7% also develop type I diabetes.</p>

<h2>Respiratory presentation</h2>

<p>Thick mucus or sputum in the lungs leads, as expected, to decreased
air intake and shortness of breath, which leads to chronic cyanosis
(dark bluish coloring of lips and nail beds).  Furthermore, the
thicker mucus is not expelled from the lungs as easily as normal
mucus, hence a higher level of mucus at any time, forming an ideal
breeding ground for microorganisms.  The most common infection is by
<span style="font-style: italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>,
causing typical pneumonia and a chronic, phlegm-producing cough.
Frequent wheezing is often noted, and permanent lung damage may be
seen on x-ray.  Lung disease is the most common cause of death of CF
patients.</p>

<p>Irritation of the respiratory tract may be seen on clinical exam,
most commonly rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and coughing up blood.</p>

<h2>Clinical diagnosis</h2>

<p>Diagnosis is most often made on the basis of a sweat chloride
concentration test.  Chloride is normally present in perspiration, and
the CFTR typically <em>reclaims</em> chloride back into the body.
Note that this is the opposite of the typical problems of CF above.
In CF, of course, the CFTR does not work properly, causing an
abnormally high level of chloride (and, due to the electrochemical
gradient, sodium) in the sweat.  In the sweat test, a small area of
skin, usually the forearm, has a chemical and a small electrical
stimulation supplied to force sweat for 30-40 minutes onto a piece of
gauze or filter paper wrapped in plastic.  The result is analyzed for
salt concentration; above 60 mmol/L is considered consistent with CF
(below 40 is normal).  The sweat salt concentration does not change
with age or with temporary illnesses such as cold, and is positive in
the vast majority of CF patients.</p>

<p>In some symptomatic CF patients with normal sweat tests, and in
young infants who do not produce enough sweat to measure, an
immunoreactive trypsinogen test can test for pancreatic
insufficiency.  This test, however, gives a large number of false
positives and even a real positive may have causes unrelated to
CF.</p>

<p>The only failsafe diagnostic testing is, of course, gene mutation
testing.</p>

<h2>Minor complications</h2>

<p>Some cystic fibrosis patients also suffer from cirrhosis of the
liver, due to the blockage of ducts from the liver similar to that of
the pancreas, choleocystitis and gallstones from the same effect on
the gall bladder, infertility (in men) due to blockage of the vas
deferens, and abnormal heart rhythms due to deyhydration and
hyponatremia (lack of sodium).</p>
