<h1>PPP Case 3 (Polyuria), Objective 5</h1>

<h2 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Describe the
etiology and pathophysiology of the most common long-term
complications of diabetes.</h2>

<p>[Note: just because we have not yet precisely defined the terms, I
looked these up in Stedman.  Etiology is generally the
&ldquo;cause&rdquo;, or more specifically the underlying or initial
workings that cause a behavior or disease.  Pathophysiology is
specifically what goes wrong in a disease.  Note also that I have
constrained this document to what causes long-term complications, not
what causes diabetes itself.  This should have been addresses in
objective 2.]</p>

<p>Major complications of diabetes mellitus include diabetic
ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperglycemic-hyperosmolic coma (or, less
severly, hyperglycemic hyperosmolic nonketotic syndrome or nonketotic
hyperosmolar state&mdash;here all three of these will be referred to
as HHNS), retinopathy, nephropathy, atherosclerotic coronary and
peripheral artery disease, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.
Most of these conditions have a similar frequency of incidence in Type
I and Type II diabetes; the exceptions are DKA, which is found only
rarely in patients with Type II diabetes, and HHNS, which is seen only
in Type II patients.</p>

<h2>Short-term complications</h2>

<p>DKA and HHNS are really considered short-term complications, as
they may occur in a diabetic patient not responding to treatment (or
not being treated) over a matter of hours to weeks.  Diabetic
ketoacidosis is accompanied by high serum glucose (usually 300-600
mg/dL), and very high serum ketone levels;  HHNS presents as very high
serum glucose (600-1200 mg/dL), with approximately normal ketones.
(There are other chemical differences in presentation of these two
conditions.)</p>

<p>DKA is the result of an insulin deficiency combined with an excess
of glucagon.  This is causes increased gluconeogenesis,
glycogenolysis, and ketone body formation in the liver, and promotes
the release of fatty acids and amino acids from fat and muscle toward
the liver.  Hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency reduce the level of
fructose-2,6-phosphate, which in turn changes the activity of
phosphofructokinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.  Glucagon
decreases the activity of pyruvate kinase, and insulin deficiency
increases the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.  All
these changes in the liver together promote the gluconeogenesis
pathway for pyruvate over the glycolytic pathway, and therefore
promotes a cycle of ever higher serum glucose.</p>

<p>Ketoacidosis is brought about by the delivery of fatty acids to the
liver, which form ketone bodies there.  The excess glucagon activates
the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, which forms ketoacids
instead of triglycerides and very low density lipoproteins.  The
ketoacids and resulting lactic acid depletes body stores of
bicarbonate, and leads to metabolic acidosis.</p>

<p>HHNS is most often seen in the elderly, and only in patients with
Type II diabetes.  As discussed with DKA, insulin deficiency increases
liver glucose production and impairs utilization.  (It is unknown why
ketones do not seem to increase as in DKA.)  The resulting
hyperglycemia causes hyperosmolality, resulting in intravascular
volume depletion&mdash;therefore, HHNS is exacerbated by failure to
take in excess fluid, and is often seen in those who are already ill
and dehydrated.  [Note: maybe I am reading this wrong, but I would
think intravascular would refer mainly to extracellular fluid, which
should increase in the case of hyperosmolality.  Any thoughts?]</p>

<h2>Long-term complications</h2>

<p>Late complications occur after several years of poorly-controlled
hyperglycemia.  Not all cells have insulin-mediated glucose uptake
(mainly muscle cells do), so all other cells have high levels of
intracellular glucose anytime the body is hyperglycemic.  This high
level of glucose often leads to glycosylation and other activations of
certain metabolic pathways, leading to further complications.
Although not entirely understood, some possible pathways for this
pathophysiology is shown in <a href="#figure1">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.

<p>Not all complications necessarily have the same pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Vascular disease remains common in those with diabetes; high levels
of glucose and/or insulin may lead to atherosclerosis, causing
coronary artery disease, limping (claudication), skin breakdown, and
infection.  Amputation of lower limbs is not uncommon.</p>

<p>About 85% of all diabetics eventually develop some degree of
retinopathy (degenerative disease of the retina), which usually does
not itself cause vision changes, but can progress to retinal
detachment or hemorrhage, which may cause blindness.  (These generally
seem to be caused by high blood pressure that accompanies DM.)</p>

<p>Nephropathy and end-stage renal disease are also caused by
hyperglycemia and hypertension;  treating the hypertension seems to
help most.</p>

<p>Neuropathy may manifest itself in several ways;  polyneuropathy is
pain and/or lack of sensation in several nerves;  mononeuropathy is
the same in a single spinal nerve.  Autonomic neuropathy is also seen,
but as we have not yet studied the autonomic nervous system, it is
only mentioned here in passing.  Sensory loss is especially troubling,
as diabetics are more prone to infection (perhaps due to less
effective blood flow), so minor trauma can become serious.  Similarly,
it is usually unnoticed when a change in weight distribution is
necessary, causing diabetic ulcers to often appear on the feet even of
active patients.</p>
