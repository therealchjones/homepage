<h1>Obj. 5: Describe fluid and electrolyte abnormalities that occur
with a chronic diarrhea syndrome.</h1>

<p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with general
physiological osmotic concepts.</p>

<p>Diarrhea results mainly from excess fecal water, water that makes
up 60 to 90% of the mass of the stool.  Typically, about 9 liters of
fluid enters the GI tract per day, and 1 L reaches the colon.  The
usual uptake of the colon is 0.8 L/day, but the colon can recover up
to four times that volume.  The stool weight of the typical adult is
100 to 300 grams per day, and diarreah may occur when the stool weight
is more than 200-300 g/day;  however, this does not tend to happen when
that is the normal weight.  It is important to note that chronic
diarrhea is most commonly caused not by excessive deposition of fluid
into the bowels, but by failure of the bowels to take up fluid that
exists within their lumena.  In the following, we will refer to loss
and failure to take up without distinction.</p>

<p>Of course, excess loss of water may cause dehydration.  Loss of
water alone causes a concentration of the intra- and extracellular
fluids, and this is often the case in acute diarrhea.  However, we
assume that a patient with chronic diarrhea has adapted to the
necessary intake of water, or has physiologically adapted to having a
higher mean fluid concentration;  we will therefore not discuss
dehydration further.</p>

<p>Loss of fluid which does not result in dehydration usually results
in electrolytic imbalance, since ingestion of isoosmolar fluid is
unusual in a chronic condition.  The colonic epithelium takes in
sodium in most situations (then passing it through to the serosa).  In
healthy patients, the colon is quite efficient at conserving sodium
and water, and even works well when the small intestine alone is
unable to maintain a sodium balance.  Typically, this fluid is mostly
absorbed in the ascending and transverse colon, which has an
approximate transit time of 15 hours.  Only a small amount is absorbed
in the descending colon, which moves matter through in only 3 hours.
Diarrhea often occurs by shortening the longer time, but may occur
with a hyperactive descending colon as well.</p>

<p>Sodium is not the only electrolyte lost in chronic diarrhea.
Commonly also lost are potassium, magnesium, and chloride.
Bicarbonate loss can also occur, and may cause metabolic acidosis.
Hypmagnesemia may cause tetany.  In some cases, feces may have higher
than normal mucus content, exacerbating hypokalemia.</p>
