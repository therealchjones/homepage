<h1>Viral Rashes: Parvo B19</h1>
<ol>

<li><h2>Clinical and diagnostic features</h2>

<p>The first phase is characterized by viremia that develops
approximately 6 days after intranasal inoculation of B19 into
susceptible individuals who lack serum antibodies to the virus. The
viremia lasts about 1 week; its clearance is correlated with the
development of IgM antibodies to B19, which remain detectable for up
to a few months. IgG antibodies develop several days later and persist
indefinitely. Nonspecific systemic symptoms lasting 2 or 3 days occur
early during the viremic phase; these symptoms include headache,
malaise, myalgia, fever, chills, and pruritus and are accompanied by
reticulocytopenia and excretion of the virus from the respiratory
tract. Several days after the onset of symptoms, a clinically
insignificant decline in hemoglobin concentration is noted; the
decreased level is maintained for 7 to 10 days, during which time
examination of bone marrow samples reveals a marked depletion of
erythroid precursor cells. Transient mild lymphopenia, neutropenia,
and a drop in platelet count also may be found. A second phase of
illness begins around 17 or 18 days after virus inoculation (after the
clearance of viremia, the cessation of viral shedding in throat
secretions, and the resolution of reticulocytopenia). This illness
mimics erythema infectiosum in adults, with 2 or 3 days of fine
maculopapular rash accompanied by arthralgias and arthritis that last
another 1 or 2 days. This phase occurs in the presence of rising serum
titers of antibody to B19.</p>

<p>Erythema infectiosum is the most common manifestation of B19
infection and occurs predominantly in children. This entity is also
called fifth disease because it was classified in the late nineteenth
century as the fifth in a series of six exanthems of
childhood. Normally a mild illness, erythema infectiosum typically
presents as a facial rash with a "slapped-cheek" appearance that is
sometimes preceded by low-grade fever. The rash may develop quickly on
the arms and legs and usually has a lacy, reticular, erythematous
appearance (Plate IID-40). The trunk, palms, and soles are less
commonly involved. Occasionally, the rash appears with maculopapular,
morbilliform, vesicular, purpuric, or pruritic characteristics. The
typical rash resolves in about a week but can recur intermittently for
several weeks, particularly after stress, exercise, exposure to
sunlight, bathing, or change in environmental temperature. Arthralgia
and arthritis are uncommon among children but are frequent among
adults, in whom the rash is often absent or nonspecific, with a lack
of the characteristic facial erythema.</p>

<p>In adults, B19 infection most commonly presents as acute
arthralgias and arthritis, sometimes accompanied by rash.  The
arthritis is characteristically symmetric and peripheral, involving
the wrists, hands, and knees most frequently. It normally resolves in
about 3 weeks and is nondestructive. However, a small percentage of
patients have arthritis persisting for months or even (in rare cases)
for years. It is not known whether these individuals have persistent
infection or an abnormal immune response to the virus.</p>

<p>Diagnosis most commonly relies on measurements of B19-specific IgM
and IgG antibodies, which can be detected with commercially available
immunoassay kits. The virus, its DNA, or its antigens are also
detected in the serum or infected tissues of some patients. Acute
infection can be proven by B19-compatible symptoms and the presence of
IgM antibodies or virus itself, whereas past infection is documented
by IgG antibodies. Individuals with erythema infectiosum and acute
arthropathy usually have IgM antibodies without detectable virus in
serum. Those with transient aplastic crisis may have IgM antibodies
but typically possess high titers of virus and its DNA in serum; the
bone marrow of these patients shows characteristic giant
pronormoblasts and hypoplasia. Immunodeficient patients with anemia
often lack readily detectable antibodies but have viral particles and
DNA in serum. Fetal infection may be recognized by hydrops fetalis and
the presence of B19 DNA in amniotic fluid or fetal blood in
association with maternal IgM antibodies to B19.</p>

</li>

<li><h2>Infection prevention via vaccination</h2>

<p>No vaccine for B19 is currently available; however, a
baculovirus-infected insect cell line that expresses noninfectious
immunogenic B19 capsid proteins is being evaluated to determine an
optimal regimen for use as a vaccine.</p>

</li>

<li><h2>Trasmission modes &amp; periods of contagion</h2>

<p>Although B19 infections occur year-round, they appear most commonly
as outbreaks of erythema infectiosum in schools during winter and
spring months. Between 20 and 60% of children in outbreaks are
symptomatic, and many are asymptomatically infected. Seroepidemiologic
studies indicate that approximately half of adults possess serum
antibodies to B19. Antibody prevalence (reflecting prior exposure and
probable immunity to the virus) rises rapidly between the ages of 5
and 18 years and continues to increase with age-a pattern probably
indicating ongoing exposure during adulthood. B19 can be detected in
throat swabbings, respiratory tract secretions, and serum, and its
detection at these sites probably correlates with
infectiousness. Thus, patients with transient aplastic crisis are
highly infectious. Their infectivity has been firmly documented as the
source of one well-defined nosocomial outbreak of erythema infectiosum
among nurses. In contrast, individuals with erythema infectiosum are
much less infectious. The usual route of viral transmission under
natural conditions is unknown but may be respiratory or through direct
contact. B19 can be transmitted during therapy with clotting factor
concentrate, even after exposure to detergent, steam, or dry heat.</p>

</li>

<li><h2>Contact isolation or quarantine requirements</h2>

<p>Prophylaxis of B19 infection with immunoglobulin should be considered
for patients with chronic hemolysis or immunodeficiency and for
pregnant women. The risk of infection for these persons may be reduced
by hand washing before eating or after contact with respiratory or
other secretions when B19 is known to be present in a
community. Patients with transient aplastic crisis or chronic B19
infection (but not those with erythema infectiosum or arthropathy)
pose a serious risk for nosocomial transmission of infection. They
should be hospitalized in a private room with contact and respiratory
isolation precautions. It is not known whether pre- or postexposure
administration of immunoglobulin prevents infection.</p>

</li>

<li><h2>Pharmaceutical antiviral treatments</h2>

<p>Erythema infectiosum usually requires no treatment; the same is
true for many cases of arthropathy. More severe cases of arthritis,
particularly those involving chronic symptoms, can be treated with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Transient aplastic crisis is
usually treated with erythrocyte transfusions. In immunodeficient
anemic patients, B19 infection should be treated with commercial
intravenous immunoglobulin, which is known to contain IgG antibodies
to B19. This therapy controls and may cure B19 infection.</p>

</li>

<li><h2>Major disease &amp; congenital complications</h2>

<p>During the 1980s, it was discovered that B19 causes a variety of
disorders ranging from erythema infectiosum (the so-called
&ldquo;fifth disease&rdquo; of childhood) and acute arthropathy in
otherwise healthy hosts to transient aplastic crisis and chronic
anemia in compromised patients to fetal infection manifested by death
or hydrops fetalis. Many of the severe manifestations of B19 viremia
relate to the propensity of the virus to infect and lyse erythroid
precursor cells in the bone marrow.</p>

<p>The studies just described indicate that B19 disease in the
otherwise healthy host, manifested by self-limited erythema
infectiosum and/or arthropathy, is almost certainly an immune-complex
disorder. This concept is supported by the induction of erythema
infectiosum through the infusion of immunoglobulins into chronically
viremic patients. In contrast, B19 disease in the compromised host
(chronic hemolytic disease or immunodeficiency syndromes) is often
serious, resulting from the destruction by B19 of erythroid precursor
cells. Normal hosts can tolerate 7 to 10 days of shutoff of
erythropoiesis; however, patients with hemolytic disease who require
increased production of erythrocytes do not tolerate erythroid cell
destruction and thus usually develop severe transient aplastic
crisis. Patients who are immunodeficient may fail to clear B19
viremia, the results being persistent infection of red blood cells and
chronic severe anemia. The fetus requires a higher level of red cell
production than do adults and has an immature immune system; both
these factors could explain B19-induced hydrops fetalis.</p>
