			<p>I (<a href="https://www.aleph0.com/~chjones">Christian Jones</a>) previously maintained several different
				sites which are now defunct; frequently their domains have expired or they are otherwise no longer
				directly accessible. Thanks to the generosity and work of the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet
					Archive</a>, old versions of the sites may still be browsable.</p>
			<p>Sites below are linked to the last meaningful content update of the site before turning it into a
				placeholder site, redirect, or otherwise less useful page or allowing the domain to expire. This is not
				necessarily the most "expansive" or "complete" version of the site. The "full contents" link is to the
				Internet Archive's list of all pages associated with the given site and their stored versions, including
				any new content created by someone taking over the domain.</p>
